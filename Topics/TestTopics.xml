<p>However as far as I can tell these guys are doing this entirely on their own accord. They don't have a license from the city. They write "tickets" in their own system and charge their own rates. They are called not by police but by random business owners. </p>

<p>To me this sounds like straight theft and extortion. Is this something they are legally allowed to do? The article claims that they are now being sued by all these big corporations, but it's unclear to my why this is being treated as a civil matter and not a criminal one. </p>

      <BODY><p>This question is hypothetical. Say I go to a job interview.</p>
<p>During the interview the interviewer says you will be dealing with a lot of middle eastern clients.</p>
<p>I said, no problem. I can do this. I have dealt with many Muslims. Muslims are simple and straight forward people. <strong>Thats why all terrorists are muslims</strong>.</p>
<p>The interview immediately caught attention to my last statement and said: "We do not accept this kind of attitude in the organization. This interview is finish"</p>
<p>I recorded the whole interview session.</p>
<p>With this evidence, can I successfully sue the company for violating freedom of speech?</p>

      <TITLE>Is it illegal to infringe copyright if your boss or your client ordered you to do it?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>The first possible scenario is this: suppose you work in a company, and you need to install some software for a client. The software needs to be purchased, but the boss tells you to just download it for free illegally (infringing copyright). You tell your boss that of course that's illegal and it's not the best way to do the job, but they tell you: "I know, but who cares, just download it for free". If you did it, who would be responsible for the illegal download in this situation? If you are responsible, how should you deal with such a situation?</p>
<p>The second possible scenario is this: suppose you are a freelance software developer, and your client asks you to install a thing for them. They give you a link to an unofficial website where you can download the stuff for free (illegally). You tell them it's illegal, and the stuff should be purchased. They tell you: "Who cares, I'm not going to spend any money for purchasing it, your job is just to do exactly what I've told you, that is, just install it, and that's it". Again who would be responsible and how should you deal with this situation? Of course here there's always the option to not accept the job since you are a freelancer, but I also wonder if there are other options in theory. For example, maybe the client could download the software illegally themself, and then only give it to you for the installation?</p>
<p>Location of the scenarios: any States of United States or any Member States of the European Union, but only one jurisdiction at a time.</p>

      <TITLE>Landlord wants access to CCTV footage after we leave and possibly in realtime while we live there</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Not sure if this question belongs here, so apologies in advance if I have made a mistake.</p>
<p>My landlord has asked me to purchase a CCTV camera to be placed above the front door. We have had a few disturbances in our area recently and they said that they would like to install it to ensure that we are safe and to give them peace of mind. We have chosen one of these new cameras that save the footage to an SD card and can also be accessed in real-time via a phone app. My landlord will be the one paying for it.</p>
<p>My landlord has asked that we do not delete the footage when we leave the property, as they want to "re-run it". I don't feel comfortable about this as I feel as though it is an invasion of my privacy. I am a young woman and don't feel comfortable about my landlord going through the footage with no real reason. What is the law surrounding this? Can I delete the footage from the camera after we leave, but save a copy for myself, so if they request the footage from a certain date (for whatever reason), then I can provide it?</p>
<p>Finally, what is the law surrounding providing my landlord with real-time access to the camera via the phone app? I feel even more uncomfortable providing this for obvious reasons, and I worry that this will be next on the list...</p>
<p><strong><strong>EDIT</strong></strong></p>
<p>Sorry for the lack of clarity, I am UK based. The camera will be placed above the front door. Our front door is facing a garden entrance, and so to get to the front door, you must enter via a garden gate which is directly in front (maybe two or three metres) of the front door. The gate is an iron gate and so you can see a very small portion of the street outside if you look from the front door. So in short, the camera will see people coming in through the garden gate as they approach the front door, and may see people passing by the garden gate on the street.</p>

      <TITLE>Can a policeman have his service weapon on him in a building that does not allow guns?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am French, so the US regulations about who can hold a gun where are complicated for me, I apologise if the question is obvious in the US.</p>
<p>YouTube brought me to a 2019 case (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE85BO6vUYM" rel="noreferrer">TV News version</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi7cjvB32Yw" rel="noreferrer">bodycam version</a> with more details) where a policeman in uniform (and with his service weapon) entered an IRS building for personal business.</p>
<p>He was then stopped and "chased" by a security guard because he did not want to remove his service weapon. The policeman was being asked whether he was on official duties (in which case I assume that the service weapon is fine, having all the right paperwork or situation), he said no and wanted to leave.</p>
<p>He was stopped by the security guard and finally, it is all the security guard's fault.</p>
<p>My questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can a policeman enter a no-gun building with his service weapon while on duty, but for personal business?</li>
<li>Can a policeman enter a no-gun building with his service weapon while not on duty (again, for personal business)?</li>
<li>Can a security guard stop someone who entered the no-gun building by all reasonable means awaiting for police to intervene? (the rationale being that someone broke the law)</li>

      <TITLE>About protecting the time and energy of a startup team against the irresponsibility of academic growth centers or private accelerators</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I have seen some rejection about my and other startups project form the Startup accelerator or Academic incubator, which is taking the team's works and energy.</p>
<p>For example, I have one green startup which have described <a href="https://elasa2next.medium.com/introducing-the-initial-idea-of-a-project-in-the-field-of-waste-management-through-cyberspace-d888f853b7c0" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>here</strong></a> and have high priority because of nature problems and ...,  but I am working on it alone for 6 months.
This startup has been hampered, Despite receiving <strong>the award and second place in an academic entrepreneurship event</strong> and <a href="https://github.com/Startup-Data/Satluneh" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the open source nature</a> of the programs with low resource request which is only a few students asking for cooperation or efficiency in order to implement the plan and not asking for the involvement of money investment or location of accelerators at the time of execution and team Construction by the university or other accelerators.</p>
<p>So that after about 6 months I have come to the conclusion that fulling the forms and participation in these events will not necessarily lead to a specific result ( creating teams).</p>
<p>For this reason, my question is about documenting and publishing the reasons for the lack of cooperation of the accelerator, in other words, debugging the behavior of the companies involved (accelerators, etc.)</p>
<p>Since the publication of correspondence information or the reasons for the rejection of this startup or others startups involves legal and ethical consideration, I have asked this question here.</p>
<p>I can do it by below methods and publishing the results of contacting with an academic entrepreneurship or Private accelerator companies on the internet (like medium site!):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Informing the accelerator and obtaining permission about the publishing the result of the reasons for the rejection of the startup and the time spent for these correspondences and filling out forms</p>
</li>
<li><p>Obtain final permission from the accelerator to publish information by recording the spoken words or ...</p>
</li>
<li><p>or ...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I have asked here for some advice on how to behave properly in these letters.</p>

      <BODY><p>I've noticed that people on YouTube and even on TV would sometimes say things like "I used to take lots of coke a few years ago" or "I used to smoke weed daily until this and that" or "Yea, I smoke weed every once in a while," or "I used to pirate games a lot when I was a bit younger" or "I used pirated Windows and Photoshop until I got a job," etc., etc..</p>

<p>Basically they are confessing to a crime, on public record, couldn't anyone come after them? They've already confessed - technically all that would have to be done is a trial.</p>

<p>In these cases: possession of coke, weed, pirating games and software. In some cases - admittance that they will do it again soon - smoke weed ("I smoke it once in a while").</p>

<p>I just keep wondering every time I hear or read it... I thought finally it's time to ask people who know what they're talking about and who may be able to satisfy my curiosity and help me understand.</p>

      <TITLE>Do I have legal rights against a company that offered me a raise to not leave, and then promptly fired me after turning down the other offer?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I was just informed of this situation that occurred somewhere by a co-worker, and was wondering what the legal ramifications are (U.S. Law). To be clear, the scenario is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tell my boss I've been offered a position at another company.</li>
<li>My boss later comes to me with a counter offer of a raise, if I choose to stay with them</li>
<li>I accept the counter offer, and inform the other company that I have chosen to stay with my current employer</li>
<li>After a week, my boss then informs me that I'm being let go, and that this should serve as a lesson to not mess with him.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the above scenario, regarding U.S. law, do I hold any legal grounds against this? What options would I have to defend myself (and my family) from being blatantly told that I was fired because I was willing to accept another offer without some other counter-offer from my current employer?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As for the chap this did happen to, I'm informed that he contacted the company who originally gave him the offer, and they were still willing to bring him on-board. So, yay (somewhat) happy ending to an otherwise terrifying situation. However, I'm specifically asking about the scenario in which he was forced to be unemployed for some period of time, while looking for another job (i.e., the other company no longer had the position open)</p>

      <TITLE>Is it constitutional for a state law to effectively mandate that a provision cannot be overruled by a federal court except the Supreme Court?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>The Texas SB.8 law has this is obscure provision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 171.209.  CIVIL LIABILITY:  UNDUE BURDEN DEFENSE
LIMITATIONS.  (a)  A defendant against whom an action is brought
under Section 171.208 does not have standing to assert the rights of
women seeking an abortion as a defense to liability under that
section unless:
(1)  the United States Supreme Court holds that the
courts of this state must confer standing on that defendant to
assert the third-party rights of women seeking an abortion in state
court as a matter of federal constitutional law; or [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it constitutional for a state law to have such a provision, essentially saying that no federal court except the Supreme one can make such a determination (which is more or less on the constitutionality of another provision)?</p>
<p>Do similar provisions appear in other state laws? Have they been tested in courts?</p>

<p>It turned out that the spring is water table dependent and as such was not present during the time of the home inspection as water levels were lower. Upon tearing up the carpet I had discovered cracks in the floor that were patched over and that the water was taking said path and, when breaking open that path, the contractors had discovered that the area around the path was hollowed out by the water.</p>

<p>The only thing indicated on the sellers disclosure was that they had sump pumps that ran no structural or foundation issues were indicated, however I am unsure if a spring is required to be disclosed in PA</p>

<p>Note: When I say there is a natural spring I mean 4000+ gallons an hour from 1 of the pumps alone. And city has tested the water disowning it as definitely ground water</p>

      <TITLE>Jaywalking and Wrong way</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>As an extension of <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/285/in-the-united-states-do-pedestrians-always-have-right-of-way" title="this">this</a> question, I am wondering about occurrences I see often on my street.</p>

<p>I live on a one way street that is relatively quiet so people have no qualms about stepping off the curb and jaywalking to the other side of the street. At the same time, many drivers think that if they drive fast enough the wrong way down the one way, that they can get to the end and turn.</p>

<p>My question is, how would the law treat a case in which a pedestrian stepped off the curb suddenly so that they moved into the path of a car going the wrong way and was subsequently injured or killed.</p>

<p>Obviously both are breaking the law in terms of "moving" violations, but would there be a chance of the driver not being charged with manslaughter? How would this most likely play out?</p>

<p>Would like to hear answers for any jurisdictions in any country because it would be interesting to hear how they differ from the US.</p>

      <BODY><p>What must a landlord do to (legally) withhold some or all of a past tenant's damage deposit (aka security deposit)? I've heard (from the tenancy office) that a landlord cannot arbitrarily withhold the damage deposit, but what does this actually mean?</p>

<p>I guess my first question is: When is a tenant held financially responsible for damage? For example, if a rock is thrown from outside and breaks the window, it wouldn't be the tenant's fault. But if the tenant spills something that stains the carpet, then it may be (though even this might be a gray area if the carpets were so old as to be due for replacement anyway).</p>

<p>When a tenant moves out, what prevents the landlord from breaking something himself and claiming it was the tenant; or putting a bunch of garbage into the house, claiming the tenant left it, and charging for the delivery to the dump? </p>

      <TITLE>US case law where riling up someone and then telling them to go to a specific location constituted incitement?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>It's probably going to be bit transparent what inspired this question, but assume someone gives a long speech in which he declares that an entity is doing terrible things and then urges everyone listening to go to the entity's specific location, but the speech doesn't otherwise contain any overt calls for breaking the law.</p>
<p>Is there some US case law on incitement that has rendered a guilty verdict in a situation like that? Or at least case law where someone was (actually) charged under similar circumstances, but the verdict was "not guilty" or even the case was dismissed early?</p>
<p>There's fairly related <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60017/could-trump-be-charged-with-inciting-the-actions-of-6th-january-2021">q here</a>, but it doesn't specifically ask for case law, nor do the answers provide any--they just quote the statutes and their own interpretation thereof. <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio</em> (mentioned there) seems somewhat relevant here, but its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action#Quotation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">general test</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advocacy of force or criminal activity does not receive First Amendment protections if (1) the advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and (2) is likely to incite or produce such action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>doesn't seem incredibly illuminating here; is riling up someone and directing them to a specific location "inciting or producing imminent lawless action" if the persons who go there do actually engage in
lawless action (even if the speech doesn't explicitly call for it)? I think some actual case law on incitement may be more illuminating here.</p>
<p>I actually found a discussion of "oblique" aka "indirect incitement" in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11572-017-9427-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">paper</a> on English law, which is illustrated (inter alia) with this hypotehtical example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second example is drawn from Mill’s essay, <em>On Liberty</em>. The passage, though occasionally mentioned in commentaries on the essay, has received little detailed consideration, least of all from a legal point of view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. On the contrary, even opinions lose their immunity when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard.</p>

<p>The video never explicitly mentions "Happy Birthday", and says that this song is "about an Egyptian river goddess finding a place to sleep on top of two sheep and a deer named Harrison, who also happens to be governor of Algiers before the French conquest in 1830".</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is phonetically identical to Happy Birthday: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hapi berth dey two ewe,<br>
  Hapi berth dey two ewe,<br>
  Hapi berth dey deer Harrison,<br>
  Hapi berth dey two ewe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The words and the creator's stated intention of what the song is about do not resemble "Happy Birthday", but the lyrics (all of which are real words) are phonetically identical. In other words, they look different on paper, but when sung are the same.</p>

<p>Assuming for the sake of argument that "Happy Birthday" was irrefutably protected under copyright law (just the lyrics, since the tune "Good Morning to You" is in the public domain), would "Hapi Berth Dey" or a similar phonetically similar song be in violation of copyright?</p>

      <TITLE>Northern Ireland: Is Homicide an offence in common law or is it an offence in statute?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>In one of the episodes of the British-Irish television series <em>The Fall</em>, a person is charged by <a href="https://www.psni.police.uk/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PSNI</a>, in Northern Ireland, with multiple counts of murder. The police officer reads out the charges in full, one by one, stating the actual offence and each time using the phrase <em>contrary to common law</em> to describe the offence.</p>
<p>I searched online a bit and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law_offence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Wikipedia page on common law offence</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common law offences are crimes under English criminal law and the
related criminal law of other Commonwealth countries. They are
offences under the common law, developed entirely by the law courts,
and therefore have no specific basis in statute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it seems that there is indeed a statute, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offences_Against_the_Person_Act_1861" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Offences against the Person Act 1861</a>, currently in effect in England and partially in effect in Northern Ireland as well which makes homicide of the type covered in that series an offence.</p>
<p>My questions therefore are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is my interepreation of the phrase <em>contrary to common law</em> correct in that it implies that the offence mentioned in the charges were common law offences and not statutory offences? If not then what does that phrase actually mean?</li>
<li>Did the writers of that episode make an error or is it that homicide is indeed a common law offence and not a statutory offence?</li>

<p>There is no Visual Studio Code mentioned. I do not get this.</p>

      <BODY><p>Note: this is a real example, but I don't care nearly enough to fight it; I ask purely out of curiosity.</p>

<p>I was at the dentist and I had a few cavities filled in. My understanding from what was explained to me is that 2 of them were filled with white, and 2 with silver; insurance covers 80% of silver, but 0% of white. The dentist never mentioned that there were options, and never mentioned that the options cost different amounts of money.</p>

<p>For that matter, I never explicitly agreed to pay for anything. What makes a medical fee enforceable?</p>

<p>Edit: I could understand situations where the patient is incapable of communicating/deciding, but nevertheless needs urgent treatment, and how in a situation like that the patient would get the treatment and subsequently be responsible for paying.</p>

      <BODY><p>Inspired by this question related to admissibility of evidence obtained from an unlawful search and seizure: <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/q/65144/2690">At an unlawful traffic stop, police searches the car and find the weapon used in a recent murder</a></p>
<p>Suppose the following facts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A uniformed police officer Al pulls over a car Bob for no lawful reason. The unlawful nature of the stop is not disputed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Al proceeds to search Bob's car without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The unlawful nature of the search is not disputed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the trunk of the car, Al finds the dead body of Cal. Cal has been stabbed to death with a knife (also in the trunk) covered in Bob's fingerprints. There is a full account of the murder signed by both Bob and Cal which describes Bob murdering Cal. There are polaroid photos of Bob murdering Cal, also in the trunk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no other evidence tying Bob to Cal's murder; no prior history, no eyewitness testimony, no missing persons reports, no indication of where Cal was murdered or why (other than the signed document) and Bob lawyered up and has refused to answer any questions on the grounds he fears self-incrimination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these facts are not disputed:</p>
<ol>
<li>would we expect any of this evidence not to be ruled inadmissible if challenged in a criminal trial?</li>

<li>Cal's body?</li>

<li>would Bob be required to claim ownership of these items to have them returned, or would returning them be the default action?</li>

      <TITLE>Can I destroy US currency?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>From what I understand, destroying US currency is illegal with 0 exceptions. Legal Information Institute says: “Whoever mutilates... cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill... or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association... with intent to render such bank bill... or other evidence of debt unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.”</p>

<p>This means that no US currency can be destroyed right? Except we did a chemistry lab on campus where we dissolved US pennies from around the 1960’s I believe. Since we “rendered it unfit to be reissued” then why wasn’t there any consequences? Did we do this illegally? They have been doing this for quite some time, how has there been no problems? My chemistry teacher <em>actually tried to claim that people can burn US currency</em> <strong>as long as you don’t go try to exchange it and use it as if it were legal tender</strong>. He said you can go exchange partially burned money at the bank, just don’t exchange it somewhere else like a store because “<em>That’s were it becomes illegal</em>”.
This is in Minnesota, United States of America</p>

<p>Please make sense of this for me, or interpret the law in a different way if I’m wrong, thanks!</p>

      <TITLE>Authority to enforce a law after it expires in New York</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Recently, with the hubbub surrounding the expiration of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_control_in_New_York" rel="nofollow noreferrer">law authorizing rent control</a> in New York City, Governor Cuomo issued a statement with this content, as quoted in the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-cuomo-warns-landlords-not-exploit-rent-law-article-1.2257485" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Daily News</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The letter, obtained by the Daily News, states that despite any temporary lapses, the new rent laws once approved will be retroactive to June 15 — so “your legal obligations under existing leases and under the passage of the new rent stabilization program will not expire on that day.”</p>
<p>The governor directed landlords to continue to follow the current law until a new law is enacted and any changes are fully understood. The legislative session is scheduled to end Wednesday and Cuomo has threatened to bring lawmakers back to Albany into special session every day if they adjourn without at least extending the existing law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, how can a governor tell people that a law, which expired, will continue to be enforced (it's no longer current law), and how can the New York State legislature "backdate" a law, given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_10:_Limits_on_the_States" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Article 1, Section 10</a> of the US constitution?</p>

      <TITLE>In 1970, how was Ted Cruz's citizenship determined?</TITLE>

<p>An article in <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/01/22/ted_cruz_has_a_very_real_birther_problem_the_law_is_not_settled_but_the_history_is/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Salon</a> claims (which is possibly invalid claim):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As late as 1961, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1802 Naturalization Act only made a child born abroad a citizen if the <strong>father</strong> was a citizen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know that only mother of Ted Cruz was US citizen; his father was a naturalized Canadian.</p>

<p><a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7177/whats-the-most-crucial-issue-when-deciding-senator-cruzs-citizenship/7185#7185">"Possible duplicate" answer</a> cites  8 U.S. Code § 1401(g) which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than five years, at least two of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years[.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is, when this current interpretation became law? Was it before 1970 when Cruz was born, or after? </p>

<p>This also suggests that Salon article is wrong (which is entirely possible)?</p>

<p>TL;DR: Salon's article would apply to person born before 1932, not to Cruz.</p>

      <TITLE>What constitutes 'taking an oath...of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof'?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am an Accidental American, which would be fine if not for their insistence on imposing <a href="https://internationalman.com/articles/this-appalling-practice-is-only-used-in-two-nations-and-the-us-is-one-of-th/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">arduous Eritrean tax requirements</a>. If filing pointless tax returns and risking double taxation ever gets too irritating, I would like to know my options for citizenship loss.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1481" rel="nofollow noreferrer">8 U.S. Code § 1481</a> provides 7 ways of losing one's citizenship. (5), ‘taking a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state, in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State’, is the simplest but comes with the catch of getting one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterly_Publication_of_Individuals_Who_Have_Chosen_to_Expatriate#Comparison_with_other_sources_of_data_on_ex-citizens" rel="nofollow noreferrer">included in some FBI records</a> and barred from purchasing firearms (which is pretty serious for America, so presumably there would be other negative consequences if I later chose to relocate to the US as a non-citizen).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, (2)—‘taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof, after having attained the age of eighteen years’—counts as relinquishment due to an expatriating act and therefore avoids the punitive consequences of voluntary renouncement (although one's name is still published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterly_Publication_of_Individuals_Who_Have_Chosen_to_Expatriate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">by the IRS</a>). The other advantage seems to be the ability to <a href="https://1040abroad.com/blog/the-difference-between-renouncing-and-relinquishing-your-us-citizenship/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">backdate one's loss of citizenship</a>, presumably with subsequent impact on any tax liabilities (particularly if the event was pre-2004).</p>

<p>That preamble out of the way, if I did decide to invoke (2), what would count and what would I have to provide as evidence?</p>

<p>General advice welcomed, but for me personally I can think of three potentially-qualifying acts: </p>

<ul>
<li>would taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_Allegiance_(United_Kingdom)#Armed_forces" rel="nofollow noreferrer">oath of allegiance</a> to join the University Officers' Training Corps (part of the British Army Reserve) count?</li>
<li>would any oath involving swearing allegiance to the Queen (e.g., <a href="https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/2943/scout-promise-law-and-motto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a Scout Promise</a>) count as declaring '...allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof'?</li>
<li>would my having gained UK citizenship count if it happened at birth, or would I need to be able to prove that I did so with <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-relinquishing-and-renouncing-US-citizenship" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an intention to renounce</a> my US citizenship (and I wasn't <em>that</em> advanced as a baby)?</li>

      <BODY><p>Some time ago, I developed a website for a client. During the development process, I used a staging server which is registered to and operated by me to host the site so they could follow development and preview the work I was doing for them. </p>

<p>At this point in development, I added some images to the site as dummy content to illustrate how things would appear when the client had added their own images.</p>

<p>I acquired the images from Google Images and one of them now appears to have been copyrighted with rights managed by a company notorious for suing webmasters for illegally using their images.</p>

<p>The prototype website was not online on my server for long, but apparently long enough for the infringement to have been detected by said notorious company.</p>

Inspections are outside-only, but they encompass quite a lot- roof, walls, yard, electrical, foundation, door locks & hinges- a full page of items in tiny 9 point font. Most of what they are inspecting can probably be done from the curb, but they do mention they will "come to your door prior to the inspection."</p>

<p>I've no objection to them inspecting from the curb, and they can probably accomplish most of their goals from that alone. But I would not be surprised to find them roaming my yard. (This is the kind of city that measures your lawn with a ruler to enforce the landscaping code.) It feels very invasive and kind of pushy. </p>

<p>My question is: <strong>does a city have any legal basis for entering a property for housing code inspections</strong>? Does the 4th Amendment apply here? I imagine that it would be considered trespassing if I told them to leave, and they refused. I also understand that this will likely cause me more headaches than if I simply let them do their thing.

<p>This followed by some more back and forth, but I think the premise of the question is clear.</p>
<hr />
<p>My question actually is to what extent a pro bono attorney client relationship has to be declared before privilege can apply.</p>
<p>On the one hand it seems reasonable to me that there has to be some declaration, otherwise every conversation with someone who is also a lawyer can later be claimed to be privileged (if it suits those involved). On the other hand, there may be conversations early on in the attorney client relationship before it is formally declared that should(?) also be privileged.</p>
<p>So, are there any rules governing when privilege applies in those pro bono cases? For this question, I'm specifically asking about the US.</p>

<p>For this reason I have drafted a Privacy Policy for my Android app. Now whenever the app starts I am asking the users consent(only once) using a tick box which IS NOT PRECHECKED.</p>

<p>Now I am having certain questions -</p>

<p>1) Can I use an pre checked tick box under GDPR?</p>

<p>2) Since GDPR also requires the data collector to ensure that the user is not under the age of 13 so I am planning to ask the users age only for that region i.e. EU Region. Now will simply mentioning that <strong>"By continuing you acknowledge that you are above 13 years"</strong> will work or will I have to ask the users age?</p>

<p>3) The GDPR requires the data collector to have a proof of the users consent. Now what kind of proof will be required for my App? I am ensuring that the user cannot move forward without providing the consent(only once) is that sufficient as a proof or is any other proof required?</p>

      <TITLE>Can a landlord refuse my request for rental because of my fluency in the local language</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I live in Czech Republic and during my search for a new flat, a landlord refused to rent me the flat because I am not fluent enough in the local language.
Is this a legitimate reason for refusing to rent a flat ?</p>

<p><strong>Full story</strong></p>

<p>I have been living in Czech Republic for several years, I am a foreigner from another EU country with a right of living in Czech Republic without a visa.</p>

<p>Currently looking for a flat, I visited a nice flat that I wanted to rent. I agreed with the real estate agent to rent it, all our discussion have been in English as my proficiency in Czech cannot allow me to fully converse with him in the local language. The real estate agent gave me his approval and before signing the contract he told me he had to ask the landlord if it was fine with him too.</p>

<p>After a few days, the real estate agent wrote me an email stating that the flat would not be rented to me because they want to rent to people speaking Czech and found another person matching this criteria.</p>

<p>I quote: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"They prefered [the other clients] because they were czech speaking." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does sound a bit odd to me professionally, but also got me thinking if this was a legitimate reason to refuse to rent a flat to somebody.</p>

<p><strong>Under Czech and EU law, is it a legitimate reason to turn down a rental request because I do not speak the local language ?</strong></p>

<p><em>Nota Bene: I am just curious about the state of the law in Czech Republic and European Union regarding this matter, I will not be taking this case to court in any sort.</em></p>

<p>So my question is: are these signs legally enforceable, seeing that they are on private property? For instance, if I fail to come to a stop at a stop sign located in a Walmart parking lot, can I get a ticket for that? If so, then <strong>how??</strong> I couldn't put a stop sign in the middle of my back yard and then have police officers hand out tickets if someone drove across my lawn and didn't obey it.</p>

<li>Cookie can not (easily) directly be linked to a user (e.g. there is another technical session cookie that stores user ID for authentication purposes, but the two are issued by separate systems, and have no relation except that they are stored in the same browser);</li>
<li>Cookie is used to track and relate behavior of the visitor (pages visited, buttons clicked, general behavior stuff. etc.).

<p>Later, I noticed on the ST website that there is a <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/license_agreement/evaluationproductlicenseagreement.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">license agreement</a> for the board.  (To be clear, I did not agree to the license when I purchased the board from Digi-Key, not even in a click-through fashion.)</p>

<p>What disturbs me about the license is that it seems to apply not only to the software/firmware, but to the physical board itself.  And it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>STMicroelectronics (“ST”) grants You the right to use the enclosed Evaluation Board offering limited features only to evaluate
  and test ST products solely for Your evaluation and testing purposes in a research and development setting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not clear that my use would be "evaluation and testing," since I intend to actually do something useful/practical with it.  (i. e. I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture" rel="nofollow noreferrer">maker</a> and intend to incorporate it into a project I'm building.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, the license says that the board may not be resold.  Although I'm not really intending to resell it, I would generally consider something I bought to be fair game to eBay when I'm done with it and don't need it anymore.  How does this restriction fit with the Doctrine of First Sale?</p>

<p>I intend to use <a href="https://os.mbed.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open source software</a> on the board, to the extent possible.  Though there are possibly some bits of the firmware (maybe the bootloader, for example) which are closed-source and cannot be replaced.  Does the existence of this firmware on the board mean that ST Microelectronics can control what the board as a whole is used for?</p>

<p>As a hypothetical, could the manufacturer of a washing machine include a "license agreement" which prohibits selling the washing machine to someone else when you don't need it anymore?  (And if the answer is "no", what makes it different than my situation?)</p>

When i say specific I mean what if the question involved names, for example "Would you kill the president?" or "Would you kill Obama?". I wouldn't think this is inherently a threat from the askers point of view but the fact that you pointed out this person in particular seems sort of threatening. Would there be legal ramifications for asking that in a public forum.</p>

<p>What about repercussions for people who respond, keep in mind this would be primarily anonymous.

<p>I know that nowadays §265.01 of the NY Penal Code governs possession and transport of such 'knives', but I could only find the revisions that were made in the 2000s, but no indication that there would have been a similar law earlier.</p>

      <TITLE>Questions regarding legal aspects of John Oliver's debt forgiveness giveaway</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>John Oliver made news a few months ago by purchasing nearly $15 million in outstanding medical bill debt for $60,000 -- less than a penny on the dollar.</p>

<p>But, I read that cancellation-of-debt ("COD") is <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc431.html" rel="noreferrer">taxable income</a>.  How Oliver got around this ("...no tax consequences whatsoever...") seems odd...</p>

<p>Oliver set up a dummy corporation ("<a href="http://www.centralassetrecoveryprofessionals.com/" rel="noreferrer">CARP</a>") and then as CEO of CARP, he negotiated the debt purchase (presumably from some other collection agency).</p>

<p>But, rather than forgive the debt directly, CARP turned around and <em>donated</em> the debt to <a href="https://www.ripmedicaldebt.org/" rel="noreferrer">RIP</a>, a charitable organization.</p>

<p>Am I to understand that this second transfer was <em>necessary</em> in order to <strong>explicitly avoid</strong> the tax consequence of COD?  I do understand that <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/tax-consequences-john-oliver-s-15-million-medical-debt-forgiveness" rel="noreferrer">COD is taxable income</a>, but "gifts" are not.</p>

<p>CARP is a simple <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/form-llc-how-to-organize-llc-30287.html" rel="noreferrer">$50 setup-fee LLC</a> (and presumably <em>not</em> a charitable organization), whereas RIP was/is an established <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-section-501-c-3-organizations" rel="noreferrer">501(c)(3)</a> charity.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that Once CARP purchased the debt, it then had rights of ownership with respect to debt collection, i.e. it could (1) continue pursuing collections from the debtors, (2) do nothing with the debt, (3) forgive the debts individually or <em>en masse</em>, or (4) donate it to a charity (which is what it did).  After CARP gave (donated) the debt to RIP, then RIP was free to forgive the debts (which is its <a href="https://www.ripmedicaldebt.org/how-it-works/" rel="noreferrer">explicitly-stated mission</a>).</p>

<p>Had CARP pursued option (3) above, then does that mean all that forgiven debt was/is taxable income as COD?</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM:</strong></p>

<p>I just now realized that, in a theoretical situation where CARP chose option (1) -- attempt to collect on the debt.  Pretending that CARP successfully collected e.g. $1 million, is this simply money that CARP can keep?  (Subject to corporate income tax, of course.)</p>

<p>I'm also assuming that "purchasing" debt gives the purchaser rights of ownership such that any collected money from a debtor cannot be further claimed by previous creditors.  Is this indeed the case?</p>

<p>I have been served notice, and have denied liability for the defense.  (I have denied it more then one time, and in unambiguous terms.</p>

<p>The informant is insisting that I either Request a hearing, admit liability and provide a submission or pay the infringement fee.  I do not intend to admit liability, nor pay them anything unless the matter has gone before the court.</p>

<p><strong>I object to having to ask</strong> for a hearing and would prefer not to do this - but this would still be preferable to acquiescing and paying the fine.  I am not adverse to appearing in court to defend myself.</p>

<p>I am having some difficulty working through Section 21 of Summary Proceedings Act.   By my - possibly incorrect - reading, the act is silent on what happens if I simply deny liability but to not ask for a hearing.  </p>

<p>The informant is claiming that if I do not request a hearing or pay the fine by a certain date, the notice will be referred to the court for collection.  </p>

<p>Question - If I unambiguously deny liability but do not ask for a hearing can the informant refer the mater to the district court for unpaid fines without a hearing having taken place?  </p>

      <TITLE>Can someone who does not consider himself a US citizen be extradited and punished for a US felony crime due to a US citizenship?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>based off of the answer to this question: <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4629/if-one-leaves-the-us-to-commit-an-act-illegal-in-the-us-but-legal-in-the-country/4631#4631">If one leaves the US to commit an act illegal in the US but legal in the country they travel to are they guilty of a crime?</a>  My first bizarre loophole question has to do with situations when someone is a US citizen, but consider themselves to be citizens of a different country with different laws..</p>

<p>Lets say you have two Individuals Bob, age 17, and Alice, who just turned 18, who live in, and are citizens of, some non-US country X, who are dating and have a sexual relationship.  Say country X considers the age of consent 16, recognizes dual citizenship, and has an extradition treaty with the US...</p>

<p>However, Alice happened to have been born on a cruise while the cruise ship was sailing through US territorial waters, thus making her a US citizen.  She has never done any of the things which can cause someone to officially lose their US citizenship.</p>

<p>Federal law states <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC02423.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">it is illegal for a US citizen to have sex with an individual under the age of 18 in a 'foreign place'</a></p>

<p>I'm wondering what, of any of these scenarios, would be illegal due to the above law and could theoretically lead to either extrication, or to arrest when/if they ever visited the US at some later date (and if one is possible but not the later).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Alice never realizing she was born actually born in US waters and never thinking of herself as a US citizen, and she never visited the US or engaged in any of the activities that cause her to lose citizenship</p>

<p>If the above would not be sufficient would any of the below situations potentially lead to prosecution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Knew she was also a US citizen and had once claimed some minor right or privileged due to being a US citizen.</li>
<li>Occasionally visits a friend or relative within the US for brief periods, using her US citizenship to allow easier entry to the US, without going through the steps of the VWP.</li>
<li>Once stayed in the US with said friend/relative for slightly more then 90 days (beyond the length a regular tourist can stay) many years ago</li>
<li>Had just spent spent 91 day summer vacation with her family relative before returning to her home country and having sexual relations with Bob.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Alice and Bob both live in and were citizens of X but originally met when both were on a vacation to the US, ultimately having a sexual relationship in their home country.</p>

<p>Would Alice potentially face prosecution, if not would this change if: </p>

<ul>
<li>The couple had (legally) engaged in sexual activity in the US prior to traveling back home</li>
<li>The couple originally met in a state where sexual intercourse would have been illegal and so waited until returning home before having a sexual relationship? </li>
<li>Alice bought bob plan ticket home, so she is officially 'transporting' bob? (section a of the above law applies)</li>
<li>Alice and bob did have a relationship prior to their visit to the US which continued during their US visit.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I realize that prosecutor discretion would usually result in no one choosing to prosecutor most if not all of the above cases, despite any  legal right, but I'm asking rather they could face charges if a prosecutor did choose to move forward for some reason.  I don't know why they would, maybe they are angry at Alice for some other legal act and this is their way of bending the laws to punish Alice in some way, maybe someone is putting pressure on Alice as some political maneuver to pressure her important father into something, maybe some prosecutor is just really gung-ho in prosecuting crimes for some reason whatever...</p>

<p>*Edit:
Looking back at the law I linked I realized that the definition of illicit sexual encounter, when outside of US territories, is effectively defined as a commercial sexual act, which negates all my examples since no one was being payed.  However, I'm not interested in the specific law so much as how any law making activities on foreign territory illegal would be applied to citizens, and only used this law because it was the only one I knew of to reliable reference.  For now umm...just pretend that illicit sexual act part of the law was not limited only to commercial acts when answering this question?  I think the heart of what I'm trying to understand wouldn't change if that law were slightly different and that's easier then my rewriting all of the above.</p>

<p>ps. A US citizen can travel to Angola and have sex with a 12 year old without any repercussion so long as he doesn't pay anyone if I'm reading the law right?  That's something I really didn't need to know about.  I knew I shouldn't have used that particular law as my example for this...</p>

<p>pps. Also the definition of "any person can be charged with a
    criminal offense" seems extremely vague since it doesn't specify what country/state laws would apply for deciding if the person could be charged with a criminal offense, and I'm sure if you look far enough countries have outlawed all kind of things as sexual offenses, like being in the presence of a women who isn't wearing a hijab.</p>

      <TITLE>Irish citizenship revoked if I live abroad after naturalization?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I have been searching about Irish naturalization requirements on the internet since quite some time and I see all the usual requirements: 5 years residence, Good character, Attend a citizenship ceremony and make the declaration of fidelity etc.., where one additional requirement was <strong>Intention to reside in Ireland after citizenship is granted.</strong></p>
<p>Now look at <a href="https://sinnott.ie/what-happens-after-being-granted-a-certificate-of-naturalisation/" rel="noreferrer">this page</a> which mentions this:</p>
<p><em><strong>Residing Outside of Ireland After the Grant of Citizenship</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a person submits their application for Irish citizenship, they are asked if they intend to have their usual place of residence in Ireland following naturalisation and the answer to this is always yes. There are occasions where people’s circumstances change which results in them leaving Ireland, for example due to offers of employment or family circumstances. Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended, the Minister for Justice has the power to revoke a certificate of naturalisation where an individual has been ordinarily resident outside of the State for seven years unless they have registered their intention to retain their Irish citizenship. This is done by submitting a Form 5 (Form CTZ2) Declaration of Intention to retain Irish citizenship by a naturalised Irish citizen residing outside of Ireland. The <a href="https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/form-CTZ2.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Form 5 (Form CTZ2) Declaration of Intention, Version 6 Jan 20</a>
must be lodged with the INIS, or with the nearest Irish Embassy or Consular Office to a person’s location. We strongly advise all naturalised Irish citizens to file the Form 5 if ordinary resident outside of Ireland to ensure that they retain their Irish citizenship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is about the "intention to retain Irish citizenship" if a naturalized person has resided abroad (outside Ireland) for 7 years. If they still want to keep their naturalized Irish status, they have to fill this form so that Ireland does not assume that they no longer wish to retain it.</p>
<p>Most countries require residence beforehand. Some require it afterwards. The US used to require this, but that is no longer the case now. Germany does not. Ireland does, but here it <strong>seems</strong> that a naturalized person can anyway live abroad for periods longer than 7 years just by filling that form (that basically declares the intention to RETAIN citizenship).</p>
<p>Based on Irish law, specifically the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, can I live abroad after naturalizing as an Irish citizen and retain my citizenship just by filling that form? Will Ireland revoke my citizenship on the basis that I left Ireland after I naturalized (while "intention to live in Ireland" was a requirement for naturalization)? If it were a country like UK or New Zealand, it would straightaway revoke citizenship by claiming misrepresentation of the intention to reside. Does Irish law require me to reside compulsorily in Ireland after naturalization?</p>

      <TITLE>Are there ways of storing personal data beyond standard GDPR limitations?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>So GDPR harmonizes legal stance of personal data in the EU — mainly by limiting storage time of certain data, and by providing citizens with a procedure to request deletion of their personal data.</p>
<p>However, there seem to be some exceptions: I suppose financial and medical institutions store data beyond limits of regular entities (this would stand to reason at least). But what interests me is another case, as described by the following principle:</p>
<p><em><strong>How long can we keep personal data for archiving, research or statistical purposes?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You can keep personal data indefinitely if you are holding it only for:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>archiving purposes in the public interest;</em></li>
<li><em>scientific or historical research purposes; or</em></li>
<li><em>statistical purposes.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose there was a service for finding out one's geneaology tree, but the information they provide themselves would be used for future geneaology research. Would GDPR allow that, or the standard provisions would simply supersede such an arrangement and allow people to withdraw the information later on? Is there a way to store such information permanently in an explicit manner (i.e. by overtly stating “we will store your data indefinitely”)? In other words, would that qualify as permanent retetion for research under the cited principle?</p>

      <TITLE>Can the law limit what heath care providers I see if I have commercial and medicaid?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>There's a bit of story to this:</p>
<p>We had been trying to find a therapist for my son. We wanted one that we felt comfortable with. We didn't care if the provider was out of network or if we'd have to pay for their services out of pocket. We found one that we all really like and have seen them for several sessions now.</p>
<p>We have commercial health insurance through my work, and my son also has insurance through the state (Wisconsin) under Medicaid. My commercial insurance has zero out of network coverages.</p>
<p>The provider billed my commercial insurance first for the services, knowing that it would likely be declined due to being out of network.</p>
<p>After it was declined, the provider then sent the claim to Medicaid, and they declined it too, saying they won't cover any of it since it was out of network to my commercial insurance. I'm fine with that, we just pay for the services out of pocket and that's that. Apparently not. The provider has told us that we can no longer see them because they cannot accept payment from us. The provider said they heard this from a representative at Medicaid and that they read it in some documents.</p>
<p>One supporting quote that I was provided with to support their claim that they can no longer see us is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BadgerCare Plus and Wisconsin Medicaid will not reimburse the provider if the commercial health insurance plan denied or would deny payment because a service otherwise covered under the commercial health insurance plan was performed by a provider outside the plan. <strong>In addition, if a member receives a covered service outside their commercial health insurance plan, the provider cannot collect payment from the member.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The provider went back to the representative to confirm that they can't bill us even if insurance isn't involved and they were told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No they can’t, that would be considered fraud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this legal? How can I not just pay for a service out of pocket? What fraud would I or the provider be committing? I'd understand if we went into this whole thing thinking that it was going to be covered by insurance, but we knew insurance likely wasn't going to cover it.</p>

      <TITLE>Why are the promises President Trump made on the travel ban not relevant to determine whether the executive order itself is constitutional?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Today (26th of June 2018), the SCOTUS decided that the Sept. 2017 Executive Order banning travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States (the "Travel Ban") does not violate the 1st Amendment of the US constitution. Notably, the SCOTUS declared that the campaign promises that the President made during his campaign rallies of banning all Muslims from entering the country (paraphrasing here) should not be taken into account when deciding whether this order is violating the 1st Amendment.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn't live in the USA and isn't a constitutional lawyer, I don't really understand that. If I say "I'm going to kill the guy who slept with my wife" and 3 days later I jump out from behind a tree and kill him, that's considered premeditation, which increases the severity of the murder charge. However, if the President says "I'm going to ban all Muslims" and then a year or so later does something to that effect, why is it not taken into account? </p>

      <TITLE>Is it legal for a landlord to refuse a lease because an Occupant on the application is an undocumented immigrant?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>(For clarity: Applicant - the adult financially responsible for the lease. Occupant - anyone over the age of 18 that will be residing with the Applicant but is not financially responsible for the lease.)</p>

<p>Is it legal for a landlord to refuse a lease application for the sole reason that an Occupant included in the application is an undocumented immigrant despite the Applicant being a US Citizen?</p>

<p>Examples would include a US Citizen who is seeking housing to live with his/her legal spouse or adult child who is an undocumented immigrant. In this case, the Citizen would be the Applicant and the spouse or child would only be included in the rental application as an Occupant.</p>

<p>One justification some landlords give is that they are unable to process a background or credit check without an SSN, however some resources such as <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/downloadable-docs/myth-buster-screening-applicants-without-ssn.pdf" rel="noreferrer">this one</a> seem to make that defense untenable.</p>

<p>I'm not an attorney but it seems to me that refusing to lease housing to an undocumented immigrant, who meets all other requirements and is only an Occupant, based solely on their immigration status is nearly equivalent to refusing to sell other necessities such as food, water or clothing to a person simply because of their immigration status. Or perhaps even worse, refusing to sell those necessities to a Citizen who is buying those necessities with or for an undocumented immigrant.</p>

<p>(Potentially relevant is the case of <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073531p.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Lozano vs City of Hazleton</a> where the Supreme Court denied to City of Hazleton their appeal to an earlier decision that ruled as unconstitutional a city ordinance that prohibited landlords to rent to undocumented immigrants. The basis for the decision was mostly due to local government being deemed to have overreached into the arena of immigration enforcement - an area explicitly reserved for the Federal government.)</p>

      <TITLE>Does Double Jeopardy prohibit prosecution, for the same event, in both Federal and State court?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>The common understanding of the 5th Amendment's prohibition on being tried twice for the same offense is that no trial can be held which would put a person in a risk of loss of liberty if they have already been tried for that even.</p>
<p>It's been suggested, in comments to <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/a/72752/11306">an answer to another question on this site</a>, that it is still possible to try someone in a state court even after a Federal trial has started and has been resolved.  The comment references <a href="https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/blog/federal-crimes/is-it-double-jeopardy-to-charge-someone-in-state-and-federal-court/" rel="noreferrer">this claim</a>, by a former state prosecutor, to support their argument.</p>
<p>I am having trouble reconciling this with the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 5th amendment does not mention that it only applies to crimes "against the United States", which is the language that is usually used to indicate that its application would be limited to the Federal jurisdiction.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment" rel="noreferrer">5th amendment's double jeopardy clause</a> has been <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/incorporation_doctrine" rel="noreferrer">incorporated</a> into protections which states must afford their citizens.  So it appears that its jurisdiction is both Federal and State.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than "it's just federalism" (which is obviously not absolute) what is the justification for this, if it's true?</p>
<p>More specifically, what is the origin of such a legal theory?  Is there a case precedent which established this understanding or has this simply been this way and has gone unchallenged?</p>

<p>At the end of the hypothetical there, they raise the possibility of someone secretly selling the same physical item (a unique car) to several different people.  It seems to me that this must be against the law <em>somehow</em>, but I don't know exactly how it's handled.  This possibility was not addressed in the discussion.</p>
<p>Concretely:</p>
<ol>
<li>I own a valuable physical object.</li>
<li>I make a contract to sell this object to each of several different people, in exchange for money.  To avoid detection, the deal is that they send me the money now, and then they pick up the item from an agreed-upon location on a specific date in the future.</li>
<li>On the specified date, all of the buyers arrive at the specified location and discover that the object is present and nobody's stopping them from taking it ... except each other.</li>
<li>I have pocketed the money and left town.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the name of the crime and/or tort I have committed?  Who gets to keep the object?  How have the courts handled this type of scam in the past?  Is it handled differently if the "valuable physical object" is real estate?  (It seems to me that this scam might be easier to execute with land, since nobody expects land to be delivered to them.)</p>

      <TITLE>Is Price Discrimination in the Software Industry legal in the US? (Sneakers resale software case)</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>There is a software manufacturer that advertises their product for $599 on their website. Conveniently, the software is always out of stock, while the manufacturer “backdoors” some licenses to a selective group of users, at a price of $6,500. Then, they raffle a few licenses at the advertised price among thousands of users. I feel like this is a clear and blatant violation to fair competition but I am by no means an expert. What strikes me immediately, though, is that the Robinson-Patman Act deems illegal the “price differences in the sell of identical goods that cannot be justified on the basis of cost savings or meeting a competitor’s price.” As software licenses are identical, I believe the act is violated. I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>what other regulations this practice might be violating?</li>
<li>is this something I can report to the FTC or other authority?</li>
<li>do I need a lawyer to do it?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It seems the post has been popular and there are additional questions as for why manufacturers do this. There is a whole secondary market for this type of software. Users buy and sell licenses at way-above-retail prices. For the software in turn, Nyte Software, retail is $599 and resell price has reached $7K at some point, in secondary markets. Manufacturers sell the copies at resale value to a select group of users, under strict rules imposed to the users on the prices they can resell the software at, all while the software is labeled as "out of stock" in their webpage (why keep the advertising of $599 in their webpage, right?). In this way, manufacturers control the market prices, while they cash through increasing the supply.</p>
<p>Additional competition questions that arise are about price manipulation through social media (manufacturers often intensively advertise the success of the software in social media to drive prices up, before selling), unfair product sale (cherry-pick buyers) and price control (strict resale rules). In <a href="https://econosneakers.blogspot.com/2021/06/the-bot-market-i-basics-incentives-to.html?m=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this blog post</a>, there is an example that shows the different things these software manufacturers do, relating to their software distribution and market practices. In fact, even when they sell de-facto at a price of $6500, they might send different invoices with the same description. This part also seems against fair competition.</p>

<p>The thing is, Meng isn't a US national, isn't on US soil and neither Canada nor China have approved the renewal of the Iran embargo, this renewal being an unilateral US decision.</p>

<p><strong>On what basis can the US have Meng arrested for violating an embargo neither her host country nor her home country agreed to?</strong></p>

<p>On an informal note, I'd understand having her or her company's assets frozen, declaring her persona-non-grata, or making it illegal to deal with Huawei, but having Meng jailed (while in a different country, no less) seems like a major overreach to me; it gives the impression that the US can just have whoever they want arrested on foreign soil for not respecting rules they decided on unilaterally.</p>

<p>EDIT - More generally, is there any US legal doctrine that non-US-citizens, outside of US sovereign territory, are subject to US criminal or civil law? Are there precedents for arrests of this kind?</p>

      <BODY><p>I recently learned that there are some companies (for instance, certain editing, writing, or translation services) that explicitly refuse to hire non-native English speakers for certain positions <em>a priori</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, a person's language abilities are both a relevant
qualification for certain jobs, which tends to be a permissible and even desirable form of discrimination, and this is highly correlated with whether they have been speaking a language since childhood or not. However, it is self-evidently not determinative of an applicant's ability to perform the duties of a job, as any "X speaking perfect Y" search will demonstrate. It also seems like the sort of policy that might run into problems due to being considered <em>de facto</em> discrimination against
an individual based on their membership in any of various protected classes. Therefore, is it legal for a company to announce beforehand that they <em>will not</em> hire non-native speakers even if they demonstrate all other qualifications for the job, or to tell an applicant who has passed any preliminary steps that they will not hire them because they are not a native speaker?</p>
<p>I am interested in answers for the United States of America and the European Union, to the extent that transnational norms around this sort of thing exist in the latter.</p>

<p>I believe the GDPR requires them to store the password securely, and if they're not hashing it then I'm sure it can't be considered secure, so should I report them to someone?</p>

<p>The only thing that makes me think this might be acceptable is that it's common for organisations to ask for certain characters of a password over the phone. I think they normally set up a different password specifically for this though, rather than using the website login.</p>

<p>I was just let go today, May 8. After being let go, 2-3 hours later I was asked to sign a general release. Obviously I declined. I told them I cannot sign a general release as I have a claim to unpaid wages. </p>

<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p>

<p>I asked a question over at Personal Finance and I was advised to ask for legal guidance here. A brief summary (please checkout <a href="https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/108689/company-stopped-paying-salary-what-are-my-options">full question</a> for details) is below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My company, based in NYC, has not paid salary for the month of April
  2019. There is no update for when salary will be paid out, but it looks like it might happen until shortly after May 20, 2019. I'm
  optimistic, but also skeptical about this. I'm also expecting a bonus
  payment for 2018 that has not been paid yet either. It is a long
  story, but apparently the funds are currently frozen in another
  country due to the firm being a 3rd party in an ongoing investigation
  that is coming to a close.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What legal options do I have here? Do I have a claim to salary if I quit? I'm nearly positive I would not have a claim to the 100% discretionary bonus. But I am thinking it is best if I quit, move back in with my parents, get a different job, and then await the payment of previously earned salary. This is unless of course I have no legal claim to accrued wages unpaid.</p>

      <ID>77733</ID>
      <TITLE>What is the effect of lost and recovered prior art on patent validity?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Normally, the existence of prior art containing matters for which a United States utility patent makes claims to patent rights prevents a patent from being issued for those claims, and if a patent somehow issues anyway, it provides a defense to a defendant in a patent infringement action.</p>
<p>But suppose that there exists prior art that is not know to anyone alive at the time that the patent is applied for and issued, but ten years later when the patent holder brings a timely patent infringement lawsuit, the prior art which had been unknown to anyone alive at the time is rediscovered. Does that invalidate the patent?</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>For example, suppose that Sharp Co. develops a process of making steel for knives that is superior in some way (e.g., it makes it much cheaper and quicker to manufacture the knives than an alternative status quo process that produces exactly the same end result), by incorporating flax oil into the process of forging its knives. It is impossible to discern that the flax process was used by physically inspecting a knife made with it after the fact.</p>
<p>Assume that this patent easily qualifies at valid by every relevant legal test evaluated as of 2012-2014 and under all changes to patent law since then that do not pertain to prior art. This process was something that no published work available to living people was aware of at the time that Sharp Co. applied for its patent in 2012, and the patent was issued in 2014.</p>
<p>In time, Sharp Co. discovers that Dull Co., a company next door to it, is using the same flax oil process to forge its knives and brings suit in 2022 for patent infringement, having copied the Sharp Co. process from its patent application, and Dull Co. gains 50% of the market share of knives made with this process costing Sharp Co. US$50 million a year in lost profits.</p>
<p>But after filing an answer in the patent infringement lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the patent infringement defense lawyer for Dull Co. who reads archaeology and linguistics texts in his spare time happens to learn that in 2016, archaeologists discovered an inscription in Old Persian from 1100 BCE in a newly unearthed tomb and translated it and published their findings in the journal <em>Nature</em>, describing precisely the same lost art of using flax oil to forge knives that Sharp Co. reinvented independently in 2012 and for which it secured its patent. No one affiliated of Sharp Co. learned about the newly discovered Old Persian texts until after they brought their infringement lawsuit and the lawyer for Dull Co. brought it to their attention. Dull Co.'s lawyer had raised the defense of invalidity based upon prior art in the answer that Dull Co. filed even though he didn't know about this particular prior art at the time.</p>
<p>Evidence from the ancient Old Persian text and some related authentic texts written by Old Persian priests from a few centuries later indicates that there were hundreds of copies of the description of this process which were included in every prayer book of the predominant religion of the region now called Iran in 1100 BCE that was freely available in each of hundreds of temples in the region to anyone interested, but it was not preserved by later scribes who decided that it was considered an obvious piece of knowledge among metal workers that wasn't worth recopying at some point in the early Iron Age, even though they were wrong and the process was later entirely forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Does the previously lost prior art, that is rediscovered before the patent of the lost prior art process expires, provide Dull Co. with a meritorious prior art invalidity defense to the validity of Sharp Co.'s patent infringement lawsuit against Dull Co.?</p>
<p>I can imagine this question functionally hinging on when prior art has to exist, and I could also imagine it hinging on the definition of what has to happen for something to constitute prior art. But, I'm not really sure exactly what the proper analysis would be.</p>

<p>This differs from the similar question "<a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15542/what-impact-does-prior-art-discovered-after-us-patent-awarding-have-on-enforce">What impact does prior art discovered after (US) patent awarding have on enforceability and even validity of that patent?</a>", because in this question, by design, there was nothing that would have operationally counted as prior art available at the time the patent was applied for and at the time that it was issued, while that question implicitly assumes that the only reason that prior art wasn't discovered was due to an inadequate prior art search when the patent was issued, and that a sufficiently thorough search for prior art at the time the patent was applied for and issued could have possibly found it.</p>
<p>This also differs from the fact pattern where someone already uses the patented process in a secret manner protected as a trade secret that is not disclosed until after the patent is issued, because, as I understand it, to be prior art, something must be knowable to people in the general public at some prior time (usually in a publication that is not confidential).</p>
<p>The example is loosely inspired by Rahil Alipour, Thilo Rehren, Marcos Martinón-Torres. <strong>"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia."</strong> Journal of Archaeological Science (2020); 105224 DOI: 10.1016/j.jas.2020.105224 (recounting their discovery that there was widespread manufacturing of chromium steel in Southern Persia around 1000 CE, a metallurgy technique that was subsequently lost and then only rediscovered about nine centuries later).</p>

      <TITLE>Windows 10 Eula Privacy Rights</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Many are claiming that Windows 10's data collection is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/even-when-told-not-to-windows-10-just-cant-stop-talking-to-microsoft/" rel="noreferrer">much more invasive than previous Microsoft products</a>, even claiming that <a href="http://www.geek.com/microsoft/microsoft-clears-the-air-on-windows-10-keylogger-1606160/" rel="noreferrer">Windows 10 ships with a keylogger</a> and reports every keystroke back to Microsoft. Most locally, <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/96713/how-does-windows-10-allow-microsoft-to-spy-on-you">this question</a> on the Stack Exchange network makes some of the same claims.</p>
<p>However, it seems that many of those sources have conflated the developer pre-release version of Windows 10 with the official release, and I'm having trouble separating the wheat from the chaff. My goal in asking this question is to look past the sensationalist reporting and see what rights Microsoft holds.</p>
<p>The official <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm" rel="noreferrer">End-User License Agreement</a> for the final retail release of Windows 10 says the following:</p>
<blockquote>

Many of these features can be switched off in the user interface, or you can choose not to use them.

<p>The referenced <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a> says the following:</p>

<p>Windows 10 ("Windows") is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub.

And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Putting aside the technical question of what information the software actually does collect (which would be off topic)...</p>
<p>From a legal standpoint, in the retail version of Windows 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does Microsoft's claim to user data differ from previous versions of Windows?</li>
<li>Does Microsoft have the right to record arbitrary keystrokes or clicks made while using their operating system and send that data to external servers?</li>
<li>Does Microsoft have the right to share user usage data with third parties (such as advertising agencies), either at a price or without compensation? Despite saying that they currently don't use data directly from our personal files for this purpose, do they have a right to begin doing so at any time?</li>

<p>Does this actually mean what I <em>think</em> it means? That if I am even part-owner of a NYS restaurant that serves alcoholic beverages, that I would be denied a Brewer's License?</p>
<p>If not, then what <em>is</em> the correct interpretation of that passage? And if I'm correct, then what would be the motivation behind such a stipulation? For instance, what if I wanted to own a "brewpub" where I would not only make and sell beer, but also make and sell food as well?

<p>The Annual General Meeting is required by law within a certain time frame, and the Memorandum of a particular "Company Limited By Guarantee" states that it must be held in January.</p>
<p>At the meeting which should have taken place in January 2021 the positions of company officers were due for election or re-election (every 3rd year), and it is those same officers who are refusing to hold the AGM, by using tactics such as</p>

I am aware of the "beyond reasonable doubt" standard in some legal systems but I'd welcome any more information of text to continue research. For an example, let us assume that it's proven that certain chemical compound can induce a specific disease - some type of cancer, for an example. It is also well established that exposure to that chemical is not sole cause of this type of cancer, so there is incidence in a healthy population. So, let say that incidence doubles and it is found that a factory upstream of affected population has been dumping this chemical into water source. Person that has this disease sues the factory. There is no scientific way to prove that the person wouldn't get it without exposure, but it can be proven that this is probable (50%) and that the person was exposed. How would such situation be viewed in continental or common law?</p>

      <TITLE>Can the GoDaddy Provider refuse to immediately delete parts of my personal data?</TITLE>
      <BODY><h1>English</h1>
<p>I am located in Germany.</p>
<h2>The issue: GoDaddy refuses to delete parts of my personal data</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I opened an account with the <a href="https://de.godaddy.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GoDaddy</a> domain provider. The aim was to register a few domains at GoDaddy. But for various reasons I then did it with a different provider. I did not have any business relationships with GoDaddy, I did not receive any paid services from GoDaddy. It is just about accidentally opening an account at GoDaddy.</p>
<p>So I wrote a formal request to GoDaddy to delete my personal data, according to the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>I will spare you the long e-mail process. Long story short: <strong>GoDaddy only agrees to immediately delete an unknown part of my personal data, but GoDaddy wants to keep another unknown part of my personal data for an unknown time</strong>.</p>
<p>Further, GoDaddy does not want to give me the information ...</p>
<ul>
<li>what part of my personal data GoDaddy wants to keep, and</li>
<li>how long GoDaddy wants to keep this part of my personal data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>GoDaddy claims to be „fully compliant with GDPR“</h2>

<p>(...)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Resulting questions</h2>
<p>Since I want to delete my GoDaddy account, and since I have or had no open business relationships with GoDaddy, I don't see what GoDaddy wants with my personal data. My personal data can be deleted without undue delay.</p>
<p>This leads to the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can GoDaddy delay the deletion of parts of my personal data?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can GoDaddy refuse to tell me which parts of my personal data GoDaddy will not delete?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can GoDaddy refuse to tell me how long GoDaddy will not delete these parts of my personal data?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I can upload my e-mail communication with GoDaddy to a GitHub Gist, if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>I will inform GoDaddy about these questions here, so that GoDaddy can join the discussion if GoDaddy so wishes.</p>

I heard that a U.S. patent is often worth 1.5 European patent, because the requirements are higher, so I am wondering if there's part of the reason here. Could you explain in detail what the advantages are?</p>

Do whole cases start right over from scratch when the high court sets a new precedent?  Do cases pause to wait for an answer?  What if two cases simultaneously ask the same question?</p>

<p>There is no law saying how long a client can wait to be serviced for warranty services in all jurisdictions that I know (in my case I would be more interested in the Brazilian law), so is there regulation or law interpretation that could be used against the servicing company that they are doing a appalling service only to avoid their responsibilities?</p>

      <BODY><p>My brother's lawyer has recommended he file for bankruptcy, and he owes me a considerable amount of money. I wanted to know what steps I can take now to protect my interests.</p>

<p>The majority of the money I've loaned him is clearly documented - a mortgage for a portion of his primary residence and several loans for which we have a written agreement.</p>

<p>But others are a little less well documented.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He owes me my share of the income from rental properties we co-own. He doesn't calculate profit/loss until several years after the activity, and by that time he's already spent the money on personal expenditures. He does provide me with documentation of the income I would have received, so that I can pay my taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>When he needs money quickly, at his request I have made sham purchases on my credit card to his S-Corp for services that are, of course, never performed. These are easily identifiable on my credit card statements, but he never in writing said that they're loans; typically he verbally states he intends to pay me back "in a few days".</p></li>
<li><p>He is the executor for our late father's estate, but hasn't settled it yet. In the meantime, he has made purchases on our late father's credit cards and has liquidated some of our father's stock, funneling the proceeds through a joint bank account they have that's still open. He's taken less than his fair share of the estate, but I wonder whether bankruptcy will let him avoid paying any of this back, lowering the value of the estate for the rest of us.</p></li>

      <TITLE>Is it allowed to ignore copyright claimed over an exact reprint of a public domain work?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>The question is general, but I will explain it with a specific example I am currently facing.</p>
<p>In 1890, a book was published in Germany. Its author died in 1915. According to my understanding of copyright law, this book is now indisputably in the public domain in every country in the world and so I can do anything I want with it, though please correct me if this is not true.</p>
<p>In 1974, a new reprint edition was published by the same publisher. At that time, the work was apparently still copyrighted, less than 70 years having passed since the author's death. The content is absolutely identical in all respects: close inspection of the two editions (which I have at hand) reveals that the 1974 edition was printed with plates that have been copied, either stereotypically or photographically, from the original 1890 plates. Apart from the title pages and the design on the endsheets, the type is indistinguishable.</p>
<p>The 1974 edition is now out of print. I have contacted the publisher (which still exists, absorbed into a large and renowned German academic publishing conglomerate) regarding licensing and reuse. They claim that they still own the copyright on the 1974 edition, and they give me a quote of over 1000 euros to reproduce even just a few pages, and around 10000 euros for the entire work (which is less than 100 pages in total).</p>
<p>Suppose I ignore their avaricious demands and reuse the text anyway. Is this safe? I do intend to credit the source, and I will claim that I am reproducing excerpts of the text from the 1890 edition (which is truthful, as far as anyone could know, because I could easily do the actual retyping and/or OCR using my physical 1890 copy). I will not mention the 1974 edition. However, the result will be that my publication will contain text which is an exact copy of the 1974 text, over which the publisher apparently reserves rights and expects licensing fees. Am I at any risk of legal trouble here, or is my defence watertight?</p>

      <BODY><p>A chain store that I frequent has banned me from their store, citing that I was seen stealing merchandise. I've NEVER stolen anything from their store (or any other store of this chain) before, and the store manager claims that their store has video surveillance. He can't admit that they have video evidence of ME personally stealing anything (which, if they have surveillance, they should have proof of, no?), but apparently, one of their employees has (mistakenly) identified me as a thief, resulting in my being permanently banned from their store. On top of that, the store manager claims that one of his employees (who he's named personally) is the one of who says that he saw me stealing merchandise. Yet, I've talked to this same employee before, and HE claims that another Asst. Manager of the store is the one who claims they saw me stealing something. So right there, they already have an inconsistency in their story.</p>

<p>There are other stores of this chain around me that I could can and do go to, but I don't like the idea of being labeled & treated unfairly for something that I didn't do, and on top of that, I feel like--and I know this sounds...fantastical--they're intentionally lying just to have a reason to ban me from their store.</p>

      <TITLE>Can I amend boilerplate contracts by mail?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am party to a number of contracts (website terms of service, for example), where a service operator writes the contract, and I agree to the contract by using the service. If the other party wants to amend the contract, they make available to me a new version of the contract, and the new contract is binding when I next use their services.</p>

<p>Intuitively, two should be able to play at this game, no? I can write up my own contract, or an amendment to the existing contract, and give <em>them</em> reasonable notice, and it should become binding on them if they continue to provide services to me when I request them. Under this theory, it's their responsibility to read and understand my contract, and refrain from doing business with me if my terms are not to their liking.</p>

<p>Is this likely to hold up in court? Or, better yet, is it likely to convince the other party to comply with my contract? Or is this sort of agreement-by-performance only binding in certain contexts, or for certain types of services? (For example, is the situation different between a web site that I browse and a service I subscribe to that sends me something in the mail every month in exchange for money?)</p>

<p>If in theory a contract can be amended by giving notice of terms and waiting for the other party to perform, what kind of notice is reasonable to give a large entity like a corporation? Presumably shooting off an e-mail to their automated support system would be insufficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>delegata potestas non potest delegari</em>: Delegated power cannot be delegated</p>

He lived in Santa Barbara, California and me and my dad are flying down there tomorrow to get some personal items and the firearm and then driving it all back to WA.  I want to know what the legal ramifications are in making this transfer?  I wish to simply drive the firearm up to WA and then register it in my name in WA, but I have heard that you are technically supposed to go through an FFL.  Meaning, we would have to go down there, bring the firearm to UPS or FedEx, ship it to the FFL dealer in WA, then once I get back I would have to go to the dealer, pay a sales tax on the firearm (which is insane seeing how i didn't buy it and it was purchased probably 30 years ago), and then pay the transfer fee to have it filed in my name.</p>

<p>Does that sound right?  Is there an easy way to do this?  If I just brought the firearm up in the car could I just bring it into a FFL (or ship it from my home address so its cheaper?) and then have them register it?</p>

In this case, Alice retains ownership of the phone, Charlie must return it and is out of pocket. Alternatively, if Alice has £100, Broke Bob steals it, takes it to Charlie's Mobile Phone Shop and buys a phone, loses the phone, then admits to the crime. In this case, Charlie retains ownership of the £100, and Alice is out of pocket.</p>

<p>Despite having myself worked in public research, I genuinely can't tell what is the difference between allowing this, or allowing a bakery to tell their clients "Remember this cake you already pay for? We gave it to someone else, but I'm sure he will be willing to sell it back to you!".</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently resigned from my job ... in NY ... Now I am being asked to tell them all my usernames and passwords for websites I used for my job as a medical biller ie, insurance websites, Medicare, eligibility websites and so forth ... Do I have to give them this information? We don't have company email accounts. So I had to use my personal email to set them up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My response was that there were probably HIPAA violations involved in this, and she shouldn't give them any information without consulting a lawyer. I've gotten quite a bit of pushback on this of the "you're not answering the question asked" variety, with explanations of "frame challenges" and the like. But I was concerned that the OP was opening him/herself up to potential legal problems, so I thought I would ask on this site.</p>
<p>I realize that there isn't enough information in the question to make a determination as to whether HIPAA violations exist, but does this question suggest that the company has some underlying issues with data security that could rise to the level of HIPAA violations? And could the OP be providing evidence of complicity (albeit unwitting complicity) in such by providing the usernames and passwords they request? And would it be a good idea for the OP to seek out legal advice before doing as the company asks?</p>

      <BODY><p>The US Supreme Court Case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korematsu_v._United_States" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Korematsu</a> (1944) ruled that the internment of American citizens of Japanese ancestry was legal out of concern for national security.

criminals would not guess, is there anything the company can do
(before or after selling it to the public, or within some "user

      <TITLE>Is it a personal care or a Company care to correct the list of Authors of a Patent owned by the Company?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>My name was missed in several patents issued by a Company with whom I was in the past. I contacted a very experienced Attorney in Employer-Employee Relations for an advice. His belief was that I cannot do anything if the Company does not want to add my name as an Author of a patent owned by The Company. However, this is a matter of Authorship but not a matter of Ownership. In Authorship it is only the Person (the Author) who matter. A Company may own the Patent but they do not own the persons names. </p>

<p>I gave the Attorney the following example: I own a Mercedes car and in my garage I replaced all the car signs of Mercedes with those of GM. I can do that because I own the car, but I cannot drive such a car on the street - It is illegal to change the Authorship (in that case Mercedes). He said "Very interesting example - I have not thought about such situation" but he remained firm on the belief that I cannot do anything to protect my name as an Author if the patent is owned by a Company, and the Company does not want to include my name regardless that the key idea of the patent is mine. </p>

<p>In other words, I think it is illegal to ignore an Author of a patent, and it is a personal care of the missing Author in the list this to be corrected. It is not a Company care. I believe that a Person do not need an agreement by the Company to file a claim for Patent Authorship and support his claim with enough evidences.</p>

What's a VPN provider? If you have one, all your internet traffic goes through it.</p>

<p>One of the largest claims PIA makes is that it doesn't keep any logs so that theoretically even if a government issues a warrant they would be unable to disclose any information on the activities of its users.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a> PIA claims "We absolutely do not maintain any VPN logs of any kind." Is it legal not to keep any logs? Did they just "pull a legal fast one" by saying <strong>VPN</strong> logs so if they were to hand over information about a user they would just say it was from a non-VPN log?</p>

      <TITLE>Why does Google require consent from users in order to process ads personalization data?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Recently, Google was fined under the GDPR by France's CNIL data protection authority. The authority found Google's processing of personal data for ads personalization lacked transparency, was inadequately informed to users and did not obtain valid consent. Specifically, CNIL <a href="https://cnil.hosting.augure.com/Augure_CNIL/default.ashx?WCI=EmailViewer&id=acbcae1a-7f3d-4d9a-b072-01a18c6ae979" rel="nofollow noreferrer">said</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users are not able to fully understand the extent of the processing operations carried out by GOOGLE. But the processing operations are particularly massive and intrusive because of the number of services offered (about twenty), the amount and the nature of the data processed and combined. The restricted committee observes in particular that the purposes of processing are described in a too generic and vague manner, and so are the categories of data processed for these various purposes. Similarly, the information communicated is not clear enough so that the user can understand that the <strong>legal basis of processing operations for the ads personalization is the consent, and not the legitimate interest of the company</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article 6.1 of the GDPR lays out the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. It seems the subparagraphs most relevant to Google's processing of personal data for the purposes of ads personalization are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6.1.(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;</p>
<p>6.1.(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;</p>
<p>6.1.(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that the satisfaction of 6.1.(b) or 6.1.(f) would preclude the need for Google to obtain consent to process personal data. The terms under which Google processes personal data for the use of ads is stated in their <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ads Data Processing Terms</a>, with the types of personal data in scope for those terms listed <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. If a user registers to Google, personally identifying their searches, are they not also agreeing to these terms, thereby satisfying 6.1.(b)?</p>
<p>Additionally, I don't fully understand why it is not a legitimate interest for Google, an ads-serving company, to process personal data for the purpose of ads personalization?</p>

Or, in other words, if one person dies then the other account holders (such as children) keep the account funds–creditors have no claim.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I saw a news story today where a state was going after a couple's assets (home, accounts, etc.) to cover a fine. A huge fine for a relatively benign offense I add as an aside.</p>

<p><strong>Theoretical question</strong>: If I put my children's names on my accounts (savings, checking, etc.), then later authorities fine me for something, and I did not pay the fine, could the account funds be seized by authorities? Or are they treated in the same way as an estate (such as held by the children)?</p>

      <TITLE>Does ratifying USMCA imply a (stealth) ratification of UNCLOS?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I tried asking this on Skeptics first, but apparently there's too much law (interpretation/opinion) and not enough fact in this issue.</p>
<p>Several conservative/right-wing sources says that if the US Senate were to ratify USMCA (Trump's renegotiated NAFTA), they would basically ratify UNCLOS by implication as well. (For more context, the US has signed but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" rel="nofollow noreferrer">not ratified</a> UNCLOS/LOST.)</p>
<p>E.g. the John Birch Society <a href="https://www.jbs.org/jbs-news/news/item/19298-usmca-may-be-voted-on-in-lame-duck" rel="nofollow noreferrer">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trade can be done without these many-paged deals. But the <strong>USMCA</strong> isn’t about trade. It is all about the establishment of regional and world government. This dangerous deal <strong>would in effect ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty -without any Senate vote on it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more detailed <a href="https://canadafreepress.com/article/usmca-sneaking-un-law-of-the-sea-treaty-through-the-back-door" rel="nofollow noreferrer">article in Canada Free Press</a> concludes with the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In article 24.18, Sustainable Fisheries Management, regulating “marine wild capture fishing,” USMCA agreement subordinates the United States to U.N.’s international authority and its many organizations. [...]</p>
<p>Sustainable fisheries must abide by the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United Nations Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and many others. (USMCA, art. 24.18)</p>
<p>A.J. Cameron stated that the “same people in the Obama Administration who crafted the TPP also crafted USMCA. USMCA back-doors many of the tenets of the reprehensible trade agreements to which we were told by politicians that we would not become a member.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The European Union and 162 countries have joined the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) which was adopted in 1982 and now called simply The Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST). [...]</p>
<p>Under LOST, any kind of maritime dispute, fisheries, environmental protection, navigation, and research must be resolved under this treaty through mandatory dispute resolution by the U.N. court or tribunal which limits autonomy. But disputes should be resolved by U.S. courts.</p>
<p><strong>When Congress approves the USMCA agreement, the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST) will also be ratified through the back-door, by including it in the USMCA.</strong>  Which senator is going the read this massive bill?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this interpretation (UNCLOS-wise) of the implication of USMCA ratification correct?</p>

      <TITLE>Short 1099 gig between FT job and unemployment</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I work for a contracting agency (call it <em>Foo</em>) and there is a team of us at a client's site.  Due to a funding/budget issue, the client has to let us all go by the end of the month, we just found out about it today.  My boss wants me to stay and work a few more days for which they cannot pay my contracting agency (due to some irrelevant logistical issues) but they procured another "vendor" (call it <em>Bar</em>) who the client can pay and they can cut me a paycheck for those few days.  I would be strictly 1099 with "Bar", so they wouldn't be paying me any benefits, just my hourly rate times the number of hours.  I was a FT W-2 employee with "Foo" and they were paying my benefits, including unemployment.</p>

<p>I plan to file for unemployment once I finish the three day mini gig extension.  However, I am confused as to what I should tell my unemployment office what my last day was and who my employer was. I had to deal with them once before in the past with a similarly unusual case scenario and the weirdness of the case postponed my request processing while I was strapped for cash (but was eventually approved) so I am hesitant to present anything but a clean cut scenario out of a fear of the same thing happening (they don't know how to process my request).  Should I tell them about the three day gig at all because I am afraid they will take "Bar" as my last employer (even though it's just 1099) or should I skip it altogether? The employment commission will not know about it because it is just 1099, almost as though you paid a contractor to paint your house.  At the same time, I would like to do it legally and not break any law.</p>

<p>The ideal scenario is if I could tell them:  My last employer was "Foo" where I finished at time T0 but I earned income in T1-T3 through an undisclosed source and I do not wish to claim unemployment on those days.  At the same time I do not want you to consider "Bar" as my last employer. So the complication comes in the form of a discrepancy between when my employment with the proper company ("Foo") ended and when my last day of work is (three days after the "Foo" job ended).  <strong>How do I account for that transition period for the purposes of unemployment?</strong></p>

<p>It's my understanding that 1 is undoubtedly illegal under this, but I'm unsure of the legality of 2 and 3.

      <BODY><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-61705370" rel="nofollow noreferrer">It is in the news</a> that a British geologist has been sentenced to 15 years for "intentionally taking or trying to take out of Iraq an antiquity", specifically 12 stones and shards of broken pottery which were in his and his college/friend possession as they attempted to leave the country.  His main defense seems to be that he had no idea he was breaking Iraqi laws.</p>
<p>I know very little about archaeology, and less about laws around the world, but I would expect most if not all countries to prohibit the removal of antiquities without specific permission.  I am also aware that one of the most important types of antiquity are pottery fragments, in terms of what we have learnt about history.  I would expect a geologist with an interest in international archaeology to know more about laws regarding this than me.</p>
<p>What are the "usual" laws about taking such items out of a country?  Any relevant jurisdiction would be interesting, but the best answer would compare multiple jurisdictions to give any idea of what someone who was familiar with this field might justifiably expect the law to be.</p>

      <BODY><p>My wife was in a car accident several months ago and a couple of our children were in the car with her.  One of them (who happens to be two years old) saw a doctor and our insurance agency has been wanting us to do a settlement for $500 (we think he's likely fine).</p>

<p>I am unfamiliar with the ins and outs of this. My concern is that </p>

<ol>
<li>If I accept the settlement and later it turns out that he <em>is</em> hurt in
some way (maybe a chronic condition) that he is unable to
communicate to us we will have no recourse.</li>
<li>If we don't accept the settlement, that we
won't be able to approach them later if he does have some injury (I
do not know if there is a time limit for claiming bodily injury
after an accident).</li>

<p>Could someone please clear up my concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In typical settlement agreements, if later medical expenses are incurred due to some unknown condition, is there any recourse?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there something akin to a statute of limitations with regard to how much time a person has to file a claim with regard to an injury (if it was not known at the time)?</p></li>

<p>Assuming you don't care about time, effort, etc., what would be the simplest, most naive approach to compiling all of US law into a single body of work? Is it even theoretically possible?</p>

How does anyone (citizens, lawyers, judges, other government officials, etc.) even verify that the actions they've taken are legal when the potential applicable laws are so vastly separated from each other being in entirely different series of documents written in format of chronological amendments?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We're trying to suss out legal considerations of a situation where we'd need to borrow firearms for the purpose of performing private for-profit scientific research on them. We're not purchasing them outright at this time because frankly, guns are expensive, we don't actually want to use them, we're in Texas, and most of all, because our investors are happy to loan them to us for this purpose. </p>

<p>The guns will be unloaded and not fired for this research, used in the specified manner and then when we're done each owner will fetch back his or her gun. I've found information relating to legally loaning guns for target shooting or hunting, but nothing much for science.</p>

      <BODY><p>NY state here. My wife and I changed car insurance several weeks ago. There was no lapse in insurance, we transitioned from Carrier A to Carrier B smoothly. I submitted my Cancellation Notice with Carrier A and confirmed (from them) that they received it and that they flagged my policy with them to expire effective the date the policy switched over to the new carrier.</p>

<p>Several days later, Carrier A made another monthly autowithdrawal from our bank account, when we no longer had a policy with them. I called them and they admitted it was an error on their end, and said it would be several days to get the amount refunded. Several days later, still no refund. I called again, and again they told me it would take a few more days. This cycle has repeated several times since, and it's obvious to me that they have no intention of actually issuing a refund.</p>

<p><strong>The kicker is: we were using a large portion of the withdrawn amount to finance our Christmas this year. Now that's out the window.</strong></p>

<p>I'd like to look into pressing charges against the carrier, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>They made the withdrawal (I believe) illegally, after we no longer had a policy with them, and even admitted it</li>
<li>We've been out a large amount of money (to us, at least) for several weeks now</li>
<li>There will be significant emotional loss if the funds aren't recovered in time for Christmas</li>

      <TITLE>Does the adultery law in New York affect the person being used to cheat with?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I found a public website regarding this law (New York Penal Law Sec. 255.17 Adultery), this one:</p>

<p>Let's say someone's wife cheats on her husband with my friend. My friend is not married, and does not have a spouse. If the husband files a police complaint in the state of New York regarding this adultery, can my friend be charged with the law? The law is worded to sound like only people with spouses can be charged. Thanks for any help.</p>

      <TITLE>How do the courts distribute the details of Injuctions and Super Injunctions to media agencies</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>There is a lot in the UK news recently about court Injunctions which prevent media reports, to protect the privacy of some party. There are also so called "Super Injunctions" where the media are not even allowed to report the existence of the injunction. (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13473070" rel="nofollow">BBC Q & A on injunctions and super injuctions</a>)</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Basically, how do the courts publicise these injunctions to media agencies without inadvertently defeating the point of the injunctions?</li>
</ol>

<p>Contempt of court is a serious offence - but I have never understood how these can be worked.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>Is there some sort of closed channel for established media agencies where these are distributed?</p></li>
<li><p>How does a small scale publisher (for example an individual gossip blogger) get access to these injunctions to make sure they're not in breach?</p></li>
<li><p>What is to stop any member of the public registering as a blogger/publisher - just to gain access to the injunction details for the purpose of learning the very details the injunction aims to keep private (ie - the name of the party seeking the injunction) </p></li>

      <BODY><p>I'd like to set up a system that will allow me to accept a payment from a customer, say $10, and distribute a portion of that $10 evenly to a variable number of third parties. The problem is I'd like to start accepting customer payments before the third parties know that I'll be paying them.</p>

<p>The process (fully explained to the customer):</p>

<ol>
<li>Customer pays my business $10</li>
<li>I inform the third parties via email that they have $X waiting for them.</li>
<li>If the third party sends me bank information, I send the payment.</li>
<li>If the third party does not sign up within X months, I give the money to charity.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this legal according to the law of Minnesota, US? Any advice is greatly appreciated!</p>

      <TITLE>Is an auto-submitting form GDPR/DPA-compliant?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>TL;DR is a form that automatically submits itself, even after the user has closed the window, GDPR-compliant?</strong></p>

<p>An organisation I am part of has an online form on their intranet for reporting incidents and near misses.</p>

<p>The other day I was going to use this form to submit a tech. incident report. I opened up the form, but then realised it was not the correct place to submit the report and closed the window.</p>

<p>Later that day I received an automated email with a reference number for the report thanking me for ‘sending it in’ and nothing that ‘the form was only partially completed.’</p>

<p>I raised this with somebody, who raised it to the national HQ. They forwarded me the reply they received, where the NHQ confirmed that the behaviour was intentional and was ‘a failsafe as such in case of a loss of network connection’.</p>

<p>I have never seen this used elsewhere—it almost seems like a well-intentioned use of the <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering" rel="nofollow noreferrer">privacy zuckering</a> dark pattern. There was no indication prior to accesing the form, or on the form itself, that it would autosubmit after interaction regardless of whether the 'Submit' button was clicked or not.</p>

<p>Is this legal under the GDPR/Data Protection Act 2018 (as it is a UK organisation)?</p>

<p>Recital 32 of the preamble to the GDPR states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>..which seems to pretty clearly exclude an automatic submission.</p>

<p>That said, perhaps there is an Art. 6, para. 1(c) or (d) exemption at play here, as workplace incident reporting is a statuatory duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</p>

<p>I can roll my two front windows all the way down, and my two rear windows half way down (due to manufacturer limitation). Unsurprisingly, I can't roll down the rear windshield, which is also heavily tinted, but I dont know whether the police cares about it.</p>

<li>Front windshield: no tint.</li>

      <TITLE>Legality of creating your own backup copies of video games you own</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>As far as backup copies of games you legally own are concerned, is there clear stance on what would be considered illegal? Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp#roms" rel="nofollow noreferrer">legal page</a> pertaining to this matter states the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Can I Download a Nintendo ROM from the Internet if I Already Own the
  Authentic Game?</strong></p>
  
  <p>There is a good deal of misinformation on the Internet regarding the
  backup/archival copy exception. It is not a "second copy" rule and is
  often mistakenly cited for the proposition that if you have one lawful
  copy of a copyrighted work, you are entitled to have a second copy of
  the copyrighted work even if that second copy is an infringing copy.
  <strong>The backup/archival copy exception is a very narrow limitation
  relating to a copy being made by the rightful owner of an authentic
  game to ensure he or she has one in the event of damage or destruction
  of the authentic. <em>Therefore, whether you have an authentic game or
  not, or whether you have possession of a Nintendo ROM for a limited
  amount of time, i.e. 24 hours, it is illegal to download and play a
  Nintendo ROM from the Internet</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand how a logical conclusion to the sentence (in bold), can be the following sentence (in bold and italics).</p>

<p>Does it imply that if you created your own backup copy of a game, in which you did not obtain from someone else on the internet, it is still not illegal?</p>

      <TITLE>If a party says something about interpretation of contract, is it binding?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Contracts can be complicated and lots of companies prefer to use boiler plate. If someone is asked to sign a contract and then asks a question about it, does the answer given by the drafter have legal weight and would be enforceable?</p>

<p>For example, if Company A emailed person B a contract and person B asked a clarifying question about the interpretation of a term in the contract, if Company A replied by email would their response be legally binding or at least valid evidence in court? </p>

<p>Specific example: if a contract says "no consumption of alcohol at work" and before signing it a person asks "if I am off the clock can I drink in the staff room", if the reply is "ok", then could the company still fire for just cause the employee for drinking in the staff room off the clock? (assuming it wasn't employment at will, the employee wasn't intoxicated and was doing the job well, etc.)</p>

      <TITLE>Does an email constitute a binding contract with regard to LLC Ownership Transfer?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I'm one of three cofounders of an LLC incorporated in Delaware. The LLC is very much a startup and has not been profitable nor has any assets. Because of lack of sales, one of our founders told us that he didn't want to continue working on the business and we parted ways. It was very informal, and we didn't go through the process of getting him off the LLC.</p>

<p>Later, the other remaining founder and I started working with a friend and wanted to bring him into the company as a replacement for the founder who left. We began a long chain of emails with my friend and the ex-founder and eventually agreed to pay a certain price for 1/3 of the company. The conversation ended by him accepting our price in exchange for a transfer of 33% ownership of the LLC. We told him next steps were we would set up a time to meet, sign the necessary documents and transfer the money.</p>

<p>About a week after that, the business lost our most valuable account whom was responsible for ~90% of the sales. That combined with some other factors led to my friend deciding that he didn't want to pursue ownership in the company and walked away from the potential transfer. The ex-founder is understandably upset, considering he thought he was about to get a nice payday from this and is now threatening legal action against us. I'm assuming he means to file a civil lawsuit to get the agreed upon sum for his shares of the company.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if he actually has a case here. Are we legally obligated to pay him and force the LLC transfer even though we no longer want it? No documents signed or filed and no money has been exchanged. I have read that in certain situations, email correspondence CAN BE interpreted as a binding legal contract. I'm unsure if that applies to this situation. Interested to hear what you all think. Thanks!</p>

      <TITLE>The UK GDPA article 17 right to erasure. Can I retain the person's ID number if it no longer identifies them?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I manage a small relational database for members of a club with about 600 members.  The 'member' table has records  holding the memberID , their name, address phone etc. The memberID is then used as a key into in other tables, such as the 'club_officers' table that hold the dates when someone with a particular memberID held certain positions in the club.</p>
<p>Under the 'right to erasure', if I delete all the personally identifiable data (name, address, phone etc) from the 'member' table, would I be able to retain the memberID in that table, associated with just a load of blank fields, so that I can still link it to other tables?</p>
<p>That way I would still be able to see that, for example, somebody with memberID  1234 was the club secretary between 2012 and 2014, which would be useful.</p>
<p>However, since nowhere in my database does that memberID 1234 provide any name, address phone etc.  I cannot identify who that person was.</p>

<p>He says the documentary is 'unauthorized' and that an 'authorized' life story is in development.</p>
<p>This got me wondering about the legalities with regards to making a documentary about a person's life.</p>
<p><strong>Is it illegal to make a documentary/biography without the subject's permission?</strong> I would think not, otherwise Tyson would have other options than only calling for a boycott.</p>
<p><strong>Are there certain guidelines that must be met?</strong> I would think that libel and defamation wouldn't be legal in a documentary/biography.</p>
<p><strong>Does the subject have to already be well known to the public?</strong> For example, could Hulu make a documentary about my life (I am not famous at all) even though my life details are still private for the most part?</p>

<p>I know part of the answer is "hire an attorney that specializes on IP to do this for you", which I will at some point; but broadly speaking, I would like to know first if this is possible and under what conditions (if any). Also, if you could also throw in a ballpark estimate of how much does this cost, that'd be awesome.</p>

      <TITLE>Can terms of service prohibit a user from quoting content on a website?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I was wondering whether Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/apps/site_scraping_tos_terms.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TOS on automated data collection</a> would actually be legally feasible.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned there is a universal right of quotation. Of course that will vary from the implementing country, but here in Germany this law is pretty strong, we are even allowed to quote entire pages, songs or pictures.</p>

<p>Does it matter whether I quote in an automated way? Suppose I visit Facebook once a day to observe a time change on the social network (e.g. a community page). Every day, I would then republish this information, explicitly marking it as a quotation, and referencing it back to Facebook.
The regulation suggests that for scientific purposes the quotation right can practically be expanded indefinitely.</p>

<p>I cannot see how Facebook could infringe with the universal right of quotation, which in this case weighs much more than their TOS. Technically speaking, there is no difference in me using a browser to visit their website, or me using a script that uses a browser to visit their website.</p>

      <TITLE>Alabama: College refusing to award Minor due to unclear/vague wording in policy</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Location: Alabama, USA.</p>
<p>I have recently completed all coursework required for my degree, including a cluster in (name changed) Basketweaving. A cluster consists of 6 specified courses (it is essentially the same thing as a minor, however, due to legal/administrative reasons at the university, they cannot legally call it a minor). One of these courses (call it UB200, intro to underwater basketweaving, course name changed for privacy), I received a C in, which is a passing grade and a satisfaction as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>As this was the only C I received for my cluster, I found a form on the university website called a "Course Forgiveness form". This form states the following relevant points. There are others I can provide if requested, but I do not see their relevance to this post.</p>
<p>Students may forgive any three courses. provided that they are <strong>not required for their major</strong> (emphasis mine).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any forgiven courses and the assigned grades remain on the transcript, but the grades are not calculated into the students cumulative grade point average.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Forgiveness is retroactive but must be done before graduation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Forgiveness cannot be unforgiven.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The same relevant points were verbatim on the course forgiveness form that I signed and gave to the registrar. No additional points were added or stated in this form.</p>
<p>In short, this form allows for a student to have 3 grades removed from their GPA calculation, but the course remains on their transcript. I took advantage of this to have the grade for UB200 removed from my GPA calculation.</p>
<p>When it came time for my degree audit, I was informed that UB200 could not be used for ANY credit whatsoever. I appealed the decision, on the basis that the wording explicitly states that course forgiveness cannot be used for courses required for a major. It says nothing concerning a cluster or minor. I asked if an exception could be made to the policy due to the unclear wording, and I be allowed to "take back" the form and have the C reinstated on my transcript, and receive credit for the cluster. This too was denied.</p>
<p>My appeals have been escalated to the provost, and all appeals have been met with the same response: (paraphrased)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your request to undo the course forgiveness has been denied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I talked to the provost concerning this, they explained that "they can't list EVERYTHING that the form applies or doesn't apply to, so I should have known what it meant."</p>
<p>I have asked each level to provide me a reference to any wording that explicitly states what they claim. They refuse to acknowledge the vague wording of the form, or provide a reference to an explanation of why the form also applies to my cluster. I have escalated this to the highest level at the university, and have been met with the same responses.</p>
<p>Due to their response of "we can't list everything that this applies to", I present Exhibit A: the pass/fail policy. This policy states the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A student is limited to 12 semester hours of credit on a P-F basis over the course of the degree. Courses listed on the Program of Study (major, minor, cognate, track, cluster, specialization, option and concentration) may not be taken P-F.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This policy explicitly spells out all types of awards/degrees. The inconsistency between this policy and the course forgiveness policy would seem to imply that the course forgiveness for credit policy explicitly applies to a major only.</p>
<p>I feel as though I am wronged. What type of lawyer (if any) would best be suited to help me pursue action against the university in order to receive credit for this? Is "you know what we mean" a valid argument from the university?</p>

      <TITLE>Is my wife required to attend a deposition?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>My wife worked as a property manager for a private owner of an apartment building about 3 years ago. Her former employer has since sold the company, and the new owners are now being sued by a former tenant who lived there while my wife was the manager, although we don't know why. </p>

<p>She was served a subpoena by the former tenant's attorney requesting her to turn in all documents related to the case. Although she was responsible for record-keeping during the time she worked there, she does not have possession of any such documents now nor does she know who does since she is no longer employed there and the building is under new ownership. She explained as much to the attorney and we thought that would be the end of it.</p>

<p>She just now received an email from the attorney asking to schedule a deposition. She has already explained to the attorney that she has no information of any kind regarding the case and I do not believe she is obligated to do anything. A deposition with the attorney would be a waste of time since my wife no longer has anything to do with the apartment and has no association with the new ownership. Could she simply explain the situation again and refuse to appear at a deposition so we can end her association with this case for good?</p>

      <TITLE>Rights protection on Google Play</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I'm faced with a problem with Google Play. We have an application which was complained by trademark violation. This situation a little questionable by our opinion but lawyers say that our application name probably violates IP (intellectual properties) of the complainant.</p>

<p>Just for example. Imagine that someone registers the trademark "news". You want to name your application as "business news" and here you are - you violate IP of owner "news" trademark and you should use another name. It's some foolish rules but I can't choose others and I have only this one.</p>

<p>So, now about my main problem:</p>

<p>Google removed our application from Google Play for Russia (our application targets to Russia users, moreover only for one city). Google suggest to contact with the original complainant and discuss their claims.</p>

<p>I changed our application name (there was a reason for removal) and I tried to contact with the complainant (and received single one response that they received my email and will think). I sent them a few emails more but they keep silence since from first response (about 2 weeks).</p>

<p>Then I contacted Google Play supports. I explained that I changed the application name and tried to contact the complainant but they keep silence. I received this response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may contact the original complainant at the email address provided
  in your Google Play Trademark Notice. If the original complainant
  contacts us specifically authorising your app to be republished in
  Russia, and your app does not otherwise violate the Developer
  Distribution Agreement and Content Policy, we will reinstate the app
  in Russia.</p>
  
  <p>If your account is still in good standing and the nature of your app
  allows for republishing, you may consider releasing a new,
  non-infringing version of your app to Google Play under a new package
  name. We are unable to comment further on the specific basis for this
  removal or provide guidance on bringing future versions of your app
  into policy compliance. Instead, please reference the REASON FOR
  REMOVAL in the initial notification email from Google Play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I asked whether we can send a letter of guarantee which should prove that we do not violate others IP (from this moment) or, as an alternative, can a local court make a decision about the application removals? But Google keeps the previous position.</p>

<p>I want to restore (not republish) my application but I don't know what can I do. This situation scares and upsets me.</p>

<p>Seems others (not only big companies but actually anyone) can complain about me and then keep silence. I don't see ways how can I influence the situation and protect my application on Google Play from reasonable and/or unreasonable attacks. I think that "Google way" (every time republish the application) is inappropriate but I don't know other ways at this moment.</p>

<p>What do you think? Can I do something?</p>

      <TITLE>Private company making it hard to delete customer's personal data</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Storyline</strong></p>

<p>A friend of mine opened an account with an online company that sells picture prints. Without her knowing, just after signing in, somehow (she did not understand how; probably through the Apple application Photos), the company came into possession of the photos she had on her computer.</p>

<p>When she realized they were in possession of her photos, she sent an email asking for the account to be closed and her personal data (photos included) to be deleted from their system. It follows a pretty long list of confusing emails at the end of which they agreed to close the account. They did not confirm they would delete the pictures though.</p>

<p>Two months later, she received a promotion email that included her pictures! She sent another email asking to stop promotional emails and also asking to delete the pictures. They answered they can't delete the pictures themselves, but they can reopen the account so that she can delete her pictures herself. She accepted it to reopen the account (which was probably an unfortunate move). Turns out, deleting pictures can only be done one at a time and there are thousands of pictures, which is more than inconvenient! That's at this moment that my friend told me the story.</p>

<p><strong>Extra information</strong></p>

<p>No payment and no banking information has ever been given to this company. Note also, if it matters, that my friend lives in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I very much suspect she is in right to 1) no receive promotion emails anymore, 2) Have them close the account again and 3) have them delete her pictures. Am I right?</p>

<p>Can you please advise us on an appropriate answer to hopefully convince the company to respect those rights?</p>

<p>It is named <strong>Shareaholic for Pinterest</strong>. It is free.</p>

<p>Today I got a trademark notice from Pinterest lawyers that the software should be removed because it is using the <strong>Pinterest</strong> <strong>trademark</strong>.</p>

<p>Other than the name of the software there is no trademark usage. And the naming also follows the <strong>for</strong> convention like </p>

<p>"gadget <strong>for iPhone</strong>" </p>

<p>or </p>

<p>"tool <strong>for Microsoft</strong>"</p>

<p>There is a proper disclaimer also that states the software is not affiliated with Pinterest in any way.</p>

<p>There is no icon or logo or any other design assets that belongs to Pinterest Inc.</p>

<p>So, rather than the name of the software or any other possible issues, Pinterest lawyers are trying to take the software by simply it is a utility for their service.</p>

<p>But I wanted to ask that can a trademark owner prevent any other person/company to create software for its trademark just simply for they do not feel like it?</p>

<p>BTW, there are hundreds of software out there for Pinterest that still exists, even they are using logo of the Pinterest and some even claim the software belongs to Pinterest.</p>

<p>What is my option now? Should I just take down the software just there is a Pinterest phrase in the name of the  software which is <strong>Shareaholic for Pinterest</strong>?</p>

      <BODY><p>When I read FERPA, I don't see any clarification as to whether they are talking about written sharing of educational records, or whether they are also talking about verbal disclosures.</p>

<p>For example, here is <a href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/node/438/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">their definition of <em>disclosure</em></a>:</p>

<p>Disclosure means to permit access to or the release, transfer, or other communication of personally identifiable information (PII) by any means (34 CFR §99.3). Disclosure can be Authorized, such as when a parent or an eligible student gives written consent to share education records with an authorized party (e.g., a researcher). Disclosure can also be Unauthorized or inadvertent (accidental). An unauthorized disclosure can happen due to a data breach or a loss, and an accidental disclosure can occur when data released in public aggregate reports are unintentionally presented in a manner that allows individual students to be identified.</p>

<p>"By any means" suggests that things that have not been disclosed in writing would also be included, but I'm not sure if I'm interpreting that correctly.  For example, what about a student's counseling sessions with the school social worker?  Does the parent need to be informed, and provide consent, for a university researcher sitting in on, and participating in, these sessions?  What about verbal background information about the student's diagnoses shared by the school social worker with the professor?  Is the answer different if the university and the high school have signed a memorandum of understanding?  Is the answer different if information obtained through presence in the counseling sessions is used for the professor's research activities?  The student is 15.</p>

<p>I'm aware that one can file a FERPA complaint in case of a violation.  If there were a serious FERPA violation, is there also in theory some way of filing for legal damages in such a situation?  This is New York, where human rights law does not apply to students in public schools.</p>

      <BODY><p>If an LLC operates from someone's home, I read (can't find source at the moment) that they want a place in their home where they exclusively work on the business (like a home office) to keep business and their personal lives separate.</p>

<p>If they don't do this and do business work from the kitchen, say, they are at risk of piercing the corporate veil.</p>

<p>Is this really all it takes to pierce the corporate veil? Assuming that all the other corporate formalities are in place, can I safely work from the living room, for example?</p>

<p>On a related note, if I get sued, will I have to prove that the place where I work is separate from where I hang out?</p>

      <TITLE>Legal boundaries of the creation of a shortened version of a long book written by someone else</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I know some really good books which are extremely long (e.g. 1000++ pages). It would be good if more people can know the content of those books. Unfortunately, they did not even start to read them unless they were much shorter, which is reasonable, not everybody have the time and/or discipline to finish such a long books.</p>

<p>What were the legal bounds or ethical issues if I created a shortened/summary version of those books (let's assume I do not copy any sentences from the original books, but I may use some of the examples of theirs and the logical structure of the books would be the same) and I self published them on Amazon.</p>

<p>I would recommend to my readers to read the longer/original version of the books if they liked mine or if they need more detailed information.</p>

<p>I feel that there is a lots of work to reduce the content of those books (again, I do not intended to just delete some paragraphs but I would write new books) and the best would be that if I do not have to deal with the original publishers.</p>

      <TITLE>Does settlement of an HOA liens wipe the slate clean?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>A house in Missouri was being sold and the owner wanted to negotiate a lower payment to settle the HOA liens because the buyer would not offer him enough money to cover both the HOA dues and the mortgage.(The amount offered actually wasn't enough to cover either amount in full)</p>
<p>The HOA liens was filed prior to the mortgage, which is owned by a private mortgagee, not a bank. The mortgagee had recently filed a new mortgage that replaced prior mortgages, after the HOA had already filed its liens. So I know the liens takes priority over the mortgage at this point.</p>
<p>The HOA agreed to a payout to release the liens that was lower than the total balance on the account.</p>
<p>Does that remaining balance disappear with the liens settlement and release, or does the difference between the amount paid to release the liens and the original account balance remain for the new owner?</p>

      <BODY><p><a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/2019/title-17/chapter-29/article-4/section-17-29-409/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wyoming LLC law 17-29-409</a> says:</p>
<pre><code>(g) In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply:

    (i) Subsections (a), (b), (c) and (e) of this section 
          apply to the manager or managers  and not the members; 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this specifically says that it applies to a "manager-managed" LLC, (and thus by definition not a member-managed LLC).</p>
<p>However, subsections (a), (b), and (c) that are referred to by this, explicitly state that they apply to "a <strong>member</strong>-managed" LLC, (thus not a "manager-managed" LLC).  For example:</p>
<pre><code>(a) A member of a member-managed limited liability company owes to the company and, 
    subject to W.S. 17-29-901(b), 
    the other members the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care 
    stated in subsections (b) and (c). 

...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Is there a possible mistake in this Wyoming law?</strong>  Because I think as it is for example, (a) is for a member-managed LLC, so how can (g)(i) apply to it?</p>
<p><strong>Did they possibly intend to say</strong> that in (g)(i) that subsections <strong>(a), (b) and (c) now also apply to a manager-managed LLC</strong>?</p>
<p>OR,</p>
<p>when they say to essentially substitute 'manager' for 'member' does this also include inside the term 'member-managed' to change it to 'manager-managed'?  I just assumed that 'member-managed' and 'manager-managed' were terms unto themselves.</p>

      <BODY><p>I'm 17 still in sixth form, but I'm currently on holiday break. Yesterday I started "training" at a fairly new tea shop (opened last december, running for roughly 7 or so months now) but I helped with everything from setup, cashier, drink making, cleaning and closing shop working 9:30am to 7:30pm. It was my first day and although I didn't help with making most of the teas (since they hadn't taught me yet) I thought it was a lot of work for "unpaid training". I signed myself up for 6 more days of training in a row, but the manager said everything will not be paid. She said only after I complete an 80hr training and pass an on-boarding test will I be get to be paid the national minimum wage £4.05 an hour. </p>

<p>I've only worked one day but it was 10hrs. </p>

      <TITLE>How to anonymize network data packets for commercial use?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am working on a project where I have to identify anomalies in network traffic of business networks with machine learning. The algorithm is feeded with captured network packets from inside of the business LAN. Since the business is located in Europe, constraints by the GDPR have to be considered. </p>

<p>I need a tool that captures, anonymizes and saves data packets with following constraints:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>values should stay unique when anonymized (e.g. the <strong>same IP address</strong>
should always be encrypted to the <strong>same hash value</strong> and any <strong>other IP
addresses</strong> must have a <strong>different hash value</strong>). This is important so the
hash can still be used as a feature for the ML model.</p></li>
<li><p>the process of capturing and saving the packets and the commercial
use of the resulting, partially hashed data packets should comply
with the GDPR guidelines. The packets are recorded on a computer
whose owner has agreed. However, not everyone on the network knows
that it is sniffed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What I have tried</strong>: I have been searching for tools specifically to capture network traffic and anonymize source and destination IP and MAC adresses and found <a href="http://www.tm.uka.de/software/pktanon/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pktanon</a>. Data captured by tcpdump can be piped to pktanon and anonymized, before it is saved. Also, the payload is completely deleted beforehand.</p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong>: Do I have to consider anything else but hashing source and destination IP and MAC adresses? </p>

<p>Apparently it is not sufficient to anonymize IP and MAC addresses. For example, it might be possible to recalculate parts of the payload with the checksum. I'm not 100% sure if this is relevant and also I do not know which encryption algorithms meet the requirements of the GDPR.</p>

<p>In another thread I have found an <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/a/28609/30533">answer</a> which elaborates the problem. It states, that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it is legal to process personal data if processing is necessary for
  the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or
  by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the
  interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which
  require protection of personal data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this apply to my problem? Is it possible to argue that it is a legitimate interest to secure our LAN by processing personal data of all incoming data packets? </p>

<p>I think I'm sort of in a gray area when processing (officially) personal data. This can further be divided into packets from employees of my own company, who can be informed, and packets from outside of the LAN.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

      <TITLE>Questions about PA Dangerous Dog Laws</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am the owner of a fear reactive/aggressive dog. I live in PA.</p>
<hr />
<p>Background</p>
<p>I take responsibility for all that my dog does, and I'm embarrassed and mortified beyond belief when he bites other dogs. I've never blamed anyone else. I believe everyone has the right to walk their dog without fear of their dog being attacked.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, I brought home a Belgian Tervuren. Having bred and raised high-intensity dogs (Border Collies) for 15 years, and looking for something a bit different (both of my remaining BC's were past ten years of age) I thought I could probably handle a Belgian Tervuren. To say it's a dog of a different color is an understatement.</p>
<p>In any case, at about 5-6 months, he began having fear issues, he was afraid of humans and other dogs. He bit a neighbor's dog, so I put up a fence. He squeezed through the fence with slats every 3 and 7/8 inches and bit another dog. (in neither case did the dogs sustain more than superficial scratches to the back. So I put up heavy deer netting inside the fence. At no time was he outside without me and a leash and harness. When he saw a dog that particularly riled him, he tore through the netting and was outside the fence, with me holding a leash and an empty harness. Again, though he attacked the dog, nothing serious happened (I had everyone get their dogs checked by vets and paid the bills.)</p>
<p>To make a long story a bit shorter, he never escaped the yard once I put in 18 gauge hardware cloth. Great! The police (called each time) warned me one more event and they would take me and my dog to court. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Last week, on getting home from grocery shopping, I didn't see that a woman was walking two small dogs nearby. On unloading my dog, he spotted them before me, and within a second, I was left holding an empty collar on a leash. He inflicted a 3 inch laceration on the dogs left thigh. I was mortified. I apologized profusely and offered to take the dog to the vet immediately. The owner declined.</p>
<p>Now the police are issuing a number of citations and summonses, and they are going to try to get my dog classified as a dangerous dog.</p>
<hr />
<p>My understanding of the <a href="https://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Animals/DogLaw/Dangerous%20Dogs/Pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dangerous dog law in PA</a> is that the dog is dangerous if it has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inflicted severe injury on a human being without provocation on public or private property.</p>
<p>Killed or inflicted severe injury on a domestic animal, dog or cat without provocation while off the owner’s property.</p>
<p>Attacked a human being without provocation.</p>
<p>Been used in the commission of a crime.</p>
<p>Has a history of attacking human beings and/or domestic animals, dogs or cats without provocation.</p>
<p>Has a propensity to attack human beings and/or domestic animals, dogs or cats without provocation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I think it's pretty clear that my dog may very well fill that shoe by virtue of that last condition.</strong></p>
<p>They further add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Severe injury is defined as, [3 P.S. § 459-102] “Any physical injury that results in broken bones or disfiguring lacerations requiring multiple sutures or cosmetic surgery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note my dog has never severely injured an animal. The very worst he's done was a superficial laceration on the inner thigh of a small dog, requiring sutures and probably antibiotics. But in PA, the magistrate hearing the case has the ability to broadly interpret the law.</p>
<p>I understand that if my dog is declared a dangerous dog, I will need to reinforce my enclosure, keep him muzzled whenever off my property, post large signs regarding "dangerous dog", and insure the dog for $50,000, post a surety bond of $50K in the event he bites a person (he has not, and is no longer aggressive towards people.)</p>
<hr />
<p>The question:</p>
<p>Tonight I spoke to a trainer who advertised that he worked with aggressive GSDs and Belgian Malinois for police work. When I told him of my dog's problems, he told me that he was a former police offer, and this is what would happen if the dog is declared dangerous:</p>
<p>I will either have to euthanize my dog, or, will have to post $250,000 bond, will lose my home owner's insurance (I already spoke to my insurance agent who had reassured me that I would not lose my home owner's insurance), and..., and..., and. When I questioned him on where he got his information, he told me he was actively involved as a police officer in getting dogs declared dangerous. When I cited the law I had read (thrice), he just insisted he knew what happens and that I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>My question is: Is this really what happens to people whose dogs are determined as dangerous?</strong></p>

<p>From widely reported news, I understand that Parliament voted overwhelmingly against the PM's plan for Brexit, but then had a no confidence vote that did not pass.

      <TITLE>Public Figures, Patents And Inventions</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Is there any law or regulation that prevents or regulates the inventions made by public figures?</p>
<p>Public figures are people with hobbies and maybe some dedicate their free time to research. Will they be allowed to create any patents or announce their discoveries <strong>while in office</strong>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extreme example - what happens if say, a person in office is a
president of the United States and they invent stuff like cold nuclear fusion
that will likely change our lives - will they be forced to hold on and
not patent it while they are in office? Will they be allowed to even announce it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reason for asking is obvious - since they are still in office (and I guess even after that in many cases) there could be conflict of interests where such person would have a lot of leverage to influence decisions pertaining to said inventions - like contracts, funding and so on.</p>
<p>If they are allowed to do it without any restrictions, are there some precedents of this happening?</p>
<p>Country I'm mostly interested in - the US, but any references to international law are welcome as well (if applicable)</p>

      <TITLE>What happens to the heirs/successors of Medicaid recipients who are members of Special Needs Trusts?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>US and NYS here.</p>
<p>I am reviewing options to try and get my elderly mother (she's 75 and quite sick with miscellaneous heart, lung and vacularity problems) eligible for Medicaid.</p>
<p>I was told about Pooled Special Needs Trusts (SNT) and my understanding is that these trusts have a special tax status with state/federal governments that enable something like the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>say Medicaid eligibility caps at $800/month in income</li>
<li>say she has a fixed income of $2000/month in income but with her frequent medical needs (copays, prescriptions, testing fees, oxygen tanks and other medical accessories) she is no longer liquid  and is having trouble affording her bill/utilities/groceries</li>
<li>she would join the trust and essentially put $1200/month into the trust and she would get a debit card for a sub-account in that trust</li>
<li>she could spend most (I believe the trusts typically keep 1% - 2% for management fees) of that $1200 on non-medical items: groceries, bills, utilities, etc.</li>
<li>she also has the other $800 (that she did not deposit in the trust sub-account) to spend as needed on anything else she needs/wants</li>
<li>Medicaid eligibility does not consider any income going into one of these trusts as actual income, and so in their eyes, she's only making $800/month and would be eligible</li>
<li>At whatever point in time she passes, Medicaid will send the trust a bill for all the money she withdrew from Medicaid, but that was "protected" by money in her trust subaccount</li>
<li>Hence if she has $3,000 built up in her trust subaccount, and Medicaid sends the trust a bill for $50,000, the entire $3,000 goes toward the Medicaid bill and heirs/successors cannot obviously access it (this is of course totally fair)</li>
</ul>
<p>So first off, if anything I have said about the above scenario is grossly misled or misinformed, please begin by correcting me!</p>
<p>Assuming I'm more or less correct though, my main concern here is: <strong>what does/can Medicaid do to collect the remaining $47,000?!</strong></p>
<p>This option to enroll her in a trust is very appealing because it would get her Medicaid eligible, and she really needs to be on Medicaid. But its a non-starter if Medicaid can come after heirs/successors to recuperate the remainder of the bill.</p>
<p>I do plan on consulting an Elder Care Law attorney at some point (with my mother present of course) but this is me doing my initial homework to see if its even a viable option.</p>
<p><strong>Can Medicaid come after heirs/successors? If she has assets (for instance she owns her house and her care completely) can they come after those?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for any steering/advice here.</p>

      <TITLE>I supposedly owe 91 dollars for a 4 dollar toll from half a decade ago. Can it be disputed and what penalty may I face if I don't pay?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Today I got a letter in the mail from 'Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson llp' claiming I had a 4 dollar toll from a state I pretty much never drive in back in 2018 that I now owe 91 dollars on now, including a 15 dollar 'violent crime' fee, because not paying tolls is very violent?  But it's okay because Delaware has an amnesty program and if I just pay in the next 20 days I 'only' have to pay 64 dollars on my 4 dollar toll.</p>
<p>As I said the state is hours of driving away from me and I couldn't imagine why I would be driving through it, though it's close enough, and long enough ago, that I can't rule out some forgotten long drive that took me through it.  I've always had an ez-pass though so I would think any toll would have been automatically payed anyways.  I've never received any notice about this supposed toll before today.  I'd honestly suspect a phishing attempt if it wasn't for their asking me to pay via credit card in an easily tracked and recoverable manner, plus sending physical mail and knowing my license plate isn't the sort of thing phishers are likely to do.</p>
<p>However, even if the fee was real I dispute being asked to pay non-payment penalties for a charge I was never informed I owe, plus I'm still skeptical how a 4 dollar toll qualifies as a 'violent crime'.  Is there any grounds to dispute something like this or will they tell me I'm guilty of not paying even if I didn't get informed I owed it?</p>
<p>For that matter, what kind of penalty would I face if I just threw the thing out?  It's been 5 years and nothing has happened, so it seems like there isn't much they could do.  I'd have no problem with paying a 4 dollar toll, but 91 dollars for a toll I was never informed about is just insane.</p>
<p>I'm in MD but the toll was supposedly in Delaware.</p>

      <TITLE>out of print board game - scan of board permitted?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>There is a simple children's board game that is apparently out of print.  May I make a color scan of the board and include it in a scholarly article?</p>

<p>May I include the scan in a blog post?</p>

<p>I want to include a visual and description of the basic game, and then describe variants that help a special learner with basic math skills.</p>

<p>I acquired this game from some second hand store.  It is in English but the box says it was manufactured in Spain in 1985.</p>

<p>The name of the company is "Sallent Hermanos".</p>

<p>What might make this a little tricky is that the board features Disney characters.</p>

<p>The box says copyright-symbol 1985 Disney.  It also displays "Educa".  I tried a search, among other places, at <a href="http://www.educaborras.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.educaborras.com/</a> -- nothing coming up anywhere.</p>

      <BODY><p>Does the doctrine of sovereign immunity extend to state officials acting in their official capacities to serve the government? Or it doesn't and people can sue officials and the representatives of the government instead of suing the government itself? Let's assume that the country is the United States. I think that unless there's gross negligence from an official I am thinking you can't sue officials, but even then I am not sure if gross negligence allows the sovereign immunity to be waved against a particular individual. What does the law say on this?</p>

      <TITLE>Michigan-Registered Car driving in California Front License Plate Question</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am moving from Michigan to California.  I am shipping my car, it is in transit.  The car is registered in Michigan and Michigan does not require the car to have a front license plate, so my car does not have one.</p>

<p>When the car gets here, there will be an unavoidable amount of time in which my car will be still registered in Michigan but will be driven and parked in California, so I will not have a front license plate.</p>

<p>I plan to register my car in California as soon as I get the chance then install a front plate. I need to find a permanent place and get my California driver's license.</p>

<p>So my question ultimately is: with my car being registered in Michigan, if it is being driven/parked in California can I still get a ticket?  Because there is an unavoidable amount of time where I will not be able to get a front license plate installed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
According to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=5200" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the law</a> it states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When only one license plate is issued for use upon a vehicle, it shall be attached to the rear thereof, unless the license plate is issued for use upon a truck tractor, in which case the license plate shall be displayed in accordance with Section 4850.5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only one license plate was issued for my vehicle when it was registered in Michigan, so would this mean that I don't need the front plate as long as the registration is Michigan?</p>

      <TITLE>Andrew Laming’s photo of Crystal White: Could the taking of the photo have been an offence?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This question is about an act that occurred in 2019 but was only reported in the last week of March 2021 by, for example, <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/prime-minister-scott-morrison-and-queensland-premier-annastacia-palaszczuk-comment-on-mp-andrew-laming/4e271baa-c492-4af6-a228-611d8aa4be0e" rel="nofollow noreferrer">9 News</a> and <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/andrew-laming-cops-police-complaint-over-taking-photo-of-womans-bottom-without-her-consent/news-story/df704a1ba4e74b3ec8d2b474e24a08cf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">news.com.au</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Laming, an MP in the Australian state of Queensland, took a photo of Crystal White in a Brisbane workplace, bending over and stocking a bar fridge. Allegedly, this photo was of “her bottom” and showed her underwear exposed over the top of her shorts; the latter claim has not been disputed. There is no suggestion that her underwear was exposed any more than usual, or that the situation depicted in the photo was otherwise indecent in any way.</p>
<p>White lodged a formal complaint with Queensland Police, but the police found that <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-01/police-clear-andrew-laming-queensland-mp-inappropriate-photo/100044350" rel="nofollow noreferrer">there was no evidence that a criminal offence had been committed</a>. Media reports do not mention any evidence at all, other than witness accounts; the photo was deleted shortly after it was taken.</p>
<p>Media reports, while covering various criticisms of this act, have not identified any specific laws that the act may have violated. Assuming the allegations are accurate, could this act have been an offence?</p>

<p>My question is, would it be illegal for a patient to obtain the Free Style Libre Pro on their own and to use it to monitor their own blood glucose levels?  Is it only manufacturers, distributors, and doctors who are bound by the FDA regulations, or would consumers face criminal or civil penalties if they use it without FDA approval?</p>

      <TITLE>House Insurance, fine art and "Actual Cash Value"?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I'm reviewing my Home Owner's Policy and something struck me as odd.  This is a Guaranteed Replacement Cost policy, but there are exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we will not pay more than the actual cash value at the time of the loss [...] for fine art, antiques, rare objects and other items which by their
nature cannot be replaced with a comparable article;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I guess that makes sense, what would "actual cash value" be?  They give a definition at the beginning of the document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>actual cash value means the cost of replacement with materials of similar kind and quality less depreciation. In determining depreciation we will consider the condition immediately before the damage, the resale value (if personal property), obsolescence and normal life expectancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, that's vague. Depreciation is normally not applicable to fine art. Appreciation is usually more of a concept that would apply.  Resale value can be extremely arbitrary and difficult to determine, much less agree upon.  "Obsolescence and normal life expectancy" wouldn't apply. Worried that "actual cash value" means the material cost of the canvas and paint, I noted they have a specific Fine Art Endorsement further down the document, which I could purchase for a modest premium. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We insure fine art but only:</p>
<p>• items valued up to $5,000, for which you have provided us with a complete description, including the year and value of the items; and</p>
<p>• items valued over $5,000, for which you have provided us with an appraisal of market value within 30 days of the effective date of this Endorsement. The appraisal must have been completed within the past 3 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I originally figured meant that so long as I have paid for this endorsement, I could value the art however I wish (with or without an appraisal as outlined above) given the premium varies based on the value. But then the next paragraph adds this in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>If you have a claim:</strong></em></p>
<p>In the event of a claim insured by this endorsement we will pay the full cost of repair with materials of similar kind and quality, or replacement with a comparable article, whichever is less, without deduction for depreciation, up to the coverage limit for this endorsement on your Declaration. No deductible shall apply to this endorsement. However, we will not pay more than the actual cash value at the time of the loss:</p>
<p>• if repair or replacement is not complete as soon as reasonably possible and within one year following the date of loss; and</p>
<p>• for fine art which cannot be replaced with a comparable article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, what?  That last bit brings us back to the situation we were at without the endorsement.  The whole "fine art, antiques, rare objects and other items which by their nature cannot be replaced with a comparable article" bit.</p>
<p>Am I correct that paying the premium for that endorsement would be useless?</p>
<p><strong>Why all this concerns me</strong>:  I have several important (to me) pieces painted by relatively unknown artists.  The cost of any given one was well under $5000, so appraisals don't apply but if I lost them I'd be out significantly.  These artists are alive and, as far as I know, still actively painting... so if a piece were stolen, I'm sure I could commission a replacement.  Is that cost the value with the endorsement? Without?</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer is to insure them separately with a company that specializes in Fine Art Collections.  But of course I'd rather not pay extra if my normal house insurance does cover it (at least with the endoresement).</p>
<p>I called the company to ask.  I thought the first person was just a trainee or something because all she did was regurgitate the policy wording verbatim.  I asked to speak with someone "higher up" and that person didn't do much better.  She was really vague and asked if I wanted the full policy sent to me.  I assumed that would go into great detail, but it doesn't.</p>
<p>I'm shocked, really, how loosy-goosy they are while they're collecting premiums.  The whole point of having insurance is in case of an event that requires it... and that's when the details matters.</p>
<p>Thoughts and opinions on how things would go down if a piece gets stolen?</p>

      <TITLE>How will changes to section 21 affect me?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>The following question relates to <em>English</em> housing law.</p>

<p>Following on from the news today that the government plans to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/15/short-notice-evictions-face-axe-in-tenant-rights-victory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">abolish section 21</a> evictions I was wondering how this affects my current circumstances.</p>

<p>For the last 4 years I have lived in a property which I rent. My financial dealings are with a letting agent who act on behalf of the landlord.</p>

<p>When we moved in initially we were required to sign a 12 month contract. Before the end of the 12 month contract we were served a section 21 and told that if we wanted to stay we would need to sign another 12 month contract rather than allowing the existing tenancy to roll on. This has continued since I've lived here.</p>

<p>I imagine the main motivation behind this practice is two fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>It guarantees the property is filled for another year</li>
<li>It allows the letting agency to charge extortionate signing fees every year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will this change in law effectively mean that my letting agent/landlord can no longer do this, i.e. I can actually move onto a 'rolling' contract at the end of the 12 month period and therefore also cannot be charged another signing fee?</p>

<p>In the addition to the above how long do acts like this take to pass through law? My contract is up in July this year (2019). What are the chances it will come into force before then?</p>

<p>Is this “typical” language for a NDA contract, or does this go further then most “standard” NDA contracts? Or have you seen “similar” language in NDAs previously? I’m not asking about legality; or whether this would be binding if taken to trial, fyi.</p>

      <TITLE>In a Payment Hearing, what is the protocol for creditor asking debtor questions? What if he believes the reply was invalid?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>At a payment hearing called by a creditor on a debtor, the debtor has the uncanny ability to avoid answering questions or gives misleading answers.
I understand in the payment hearing the creditor can put questions to the debtor. How exactly does this work? Does the creditor ask him directly, debtor replies to creditor, and if creditor is not satisfied with the reply he requests the judge to tell debtor he has to answer more clearly, or what?</p>
<p>For example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creditor: do you own any companies?<br />
Debtor: I think you already know the answer to this.<br />
Creditor: You honor, the Debtor did not answer.<br />
Judge: Debtor, answer the question.</p>

      <TITLE>When a contractor develops a program based on clients specifications, who owns the rights?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I was hired to create a computer program. The client gave me directions on what it should do and how the UI should look like (complete with pictures). No formal contract was ever made, and I realize now this was a mistake. My question is, in the absence of everything else, am I allowed to post the code on sites like Github and give it an open source license? This might upset the client as they may be intending to sell the program.
My friend pointed out, an idea is automatically copyrighted when someone comes up with it. So the client would own the program because they came up with the need for it and its functionality. Is this correct? If I'm not their employee but a contractor, how might this affect it? This in Canada.</p>

<p>The program is relatively simple and doesn't contain any trade secrets or proprietary business logic (it's more of a productivity tool for the average PC user). </p>

<p>TL;DR would it be breaking the law if the contractor made the source code available to the public even if the client didn't want them to (if no contracts were agreed)?</p>

      <BODY><p>I am a volunteer translator-advocate for a friend.  Her son used to have shared custody, but a couple of months ago, my friend went to family court to change this.  Now my friend has custody but the father has visitation rights, for two days per week.  The father may choose whichever days he likes.  (He has an irregular, somewhat unpredictable work schedule.)</p>

<p>The father is upset about the change, and has stopped answering his phone.  He doesn't respond to text messages either.  He has not taken the initiative to have his son for a visit.  He has not responded to a letter the boy dictated to me which we sent through the mail.</p>

<p>What is a succinct way of describing the fact that the father has, in essence, abandoned the child emotionally?  (He is still paying child support.)  I need a succinct description for the purposes of letting the child's school know, so they can be sensitive to the child's feelings.  (He is relieved not to be living half-time with his father, who was abusive, but at the same time he is devastated at the total lack of contact.)</p>

      <BODY><p>Reading this <a href="https://www.moneysupermarket.com/mortgages/mortgage-charges-explained/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Money Supermarket article</a> about various fees associated with buying a house, I came across an "Own Building Insurance Fee", which is described as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is charged by your mortgage lender for checking you have taken out building insurance if you choose not to buy it from them. The fees are fairly small – around £25 to £50 each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assesment of "fairly small" seems to be relative to other fees as it still seems to me like quite a lot for what I imagine is essentially glancing at a document. I can't escape the feeling that the primary purpose of the fee is to encourage homeowners to buy insurance from the mortgage provider, by financially punishing them for buying elsewhere.</p>

Maybe he/she improved an idea I already posted.

I don't want to get to be in a situation where someone demands something from me because 'they came up with it'.

Also, to make it easier, let's say the verdict will be "not guilty" and they will become an "acquitted person".</p>
<p>Is it when there is a unanimous jury vote? When they fill out a form attesting to their vote (if this is done)? When the verdict is read? When the verdict is recorded by the court recorder? Something else?</p>
<p>Consider it as a thought experiment that starts from the point of initial jury deliberation to when the denfendant's legal status officially and irrevocably is "acquitted person".

<p>When we moved into our new place I called the service provider to transfer our service to our new home. Unfortunately, at that time the company stated they do not service our new property address (fwiw - my account is paid in full and good standing for services used). ...Long story short a few weeks later I get a notice for an early termination fee.</p>

<p>I've been fighting this for 2+ months now.  I've spent hours with countless phone reps and getting the boilerplate, "these charges are valid due to termination of service." I stated in many words I didn't terminate the contract, I asked for my service to be transferred to my new address." I asked the question in a few different ways and the service rep states, "moving to avoid a service charge is not valid."</p>

<p>I asked a phone rep manager, "how can a customer be held responsible for where a service provider provides service?" The answer given was, "to avoid ETF you should call [us] before purchasing a home." </p>

<p>This seems unreal, unjust, and possibly unconstitutional.  Am I crazy?
How is it that "blah blah blah big company" can place their interests above a citizen's choice of where to live (school district, neighborhood, etc.)?</p>

      <TITLE>Would a private business be liable for false warrant canary?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Suppose there is a private business whose business model is based on the <em>trust</em> of its customers that it has not been served with a secret government subpoena. That is, if the customers knew (or could infer) that such a subpoena has been served, they will likely be customers no longer.</p>
<p>The business regularly updates its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary" rel="nofollow noreferrer">warrant canary</a> to maintain the customers' trust.</p>
<p>Now, suppose the business has actually <em>been</em> served with a secret government subpoena, but elects to falsely maintain the warrant canary anyway. Or, rather, continuing to maintain the canary is actually part of the government order.</p>
<p>Should the breach of trust be unveiled by the customers and the damage be quantifiable, would the customers have a case, possibly class action?</p>
<p>My doubt is that the business could possibly have this defense that it was acting at the orders of the government (which cannot be liable). Will that defense shield the business from any liability?</p>
<p>Essentially, what the question drives at is whether there is any sense in a warrant canary in principle. If a business is <em>never</em> liable for lying in its warrant canary, then how can one possibly trust a warrant canary at all?</p>

<p>Robbery in Golden Gate Park:</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, I was witness to and nearly a victim of an aggressive robbery near the bison paddock on JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park. I was photographing great horned owls. Around 8:10PM, I was packing up equipment and putting it in my car. Another photographer was doing the same further down the road behind me. As this person got in their car, I saw a small white car pull up and abruptly stop right next to it. A masked man jumped out and began smashing in the rear window of the other photographer’s car.</p>
<p>By the time I got my wits about me and managed to get into my car and start the engine - no more than 10 seconds - they had finished robbing the other person and had now pulled up alongside me. The passenger-side door opened and the masked assailant began to step out, ready to smash his way into my car. With only a few seconds to spare, I stepped on the gas and pulled away, fully expecting that they would give up and flee. But they chased me, and pulled up alongside me, either trying to run me off the road or cut me off and stop me. I sped up and got ahead of them.</p>
<p>Probably going 50MPH with the assailants’ car right behind me, we ran through two stop signs and barreled over speed bumps for nearly a mile before they slowed down, made a U-turn, and disappeared out the 33rd Ave gate. (Keep in mind, I bike this road nearly every day and am very respectful of more vulnerable road users when in my car. I gave the few cyclists that happened to be out a wide berth as we passed.)</p>
<p>I circled back and by then the cops were there. I gave a statement, along with the other victim and two witnesses. Nobody saw their faces or license plate. They were fast, prepared, and extremely aggressive.</p>
<p>The officer explained that these smash-and-grabs are merely considered property crimes and are NOT considered violent crimes (yes, you read that correctly) so they don't really pursue them, and if they did hypothetically make an arrest, the judge would just let them go, including repeat offenders. He even said if police were to witness one of these incidents occur, they would NOT chase the culprits. He also informed me that if one were to fight back and injure (or worse) one of these thieves during a robbery, then that person would likely be charged with assault for using violence against a "non-violent" criminal. Unbelievable. So scary and so very frustrating.</p>
<p>So be careful out there. I am finished shooting pictures and video in the park. Way too dangerous, and the police are not going to be there when you need them. And even if they were, they wouldn't help you anyway. I'm sharing this story as a reminder to others to stay in groups, and always be aware of your surroundings.</p>

<li>MPEP = detailed guidance on interpretation of the USC title 35</li>

<p>Should I mention the use of the MIT code elsewhere, for example in a license.txt file?</p>

<p>Does claiming the copyright on the javascript file prevents people from using the modifications from the original code?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Reading the common form of the MIT license again and with the help of the answer of gnasher729, I answered most of my questions. The new code added in the file is copyrighted by me and the part that hasn't been modified is still copyrighted by the original author. I don't need to mention somewhere else the use of the MIT code.</p>

<p>However, the copyright notice below and the permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. This indicates that I should copy the MIT license and the name of the author above every portion of the code that I haven't modified. This is pretty much infeasible, so my guess is that mentioning the original author with a link to the original code is enough. I should also add the MIT license copyright notice in the file as well but this will add a overhead to every client downloading the website, so I probably won't.</p>

      <TITLE>Is appeal to Disciplinary Review Committee worth it (Barbering & Cosmetology)?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am helping a friend who has to attend Disciplinary Hearing (California).</p>

<p>Basically the inspector checked foot SPA at her beauty salon and took off the foot SPA screen (the white thing in the picture) and told that it is not clean enough so she has to pay $500 fine.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzIti.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzIti.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Well, she cleans Foot SPA after every customer, but, yes, it seems that screen was not brushed to a perfectly clean state so that only white plastic surface would be visible. And I found that the regulations at <a href="http://www.barbercosmo.ca.gov/laws_regs/act_regs.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.barbercosmo.ca.gov/laws_regs/act_regs.pdf</a> quite explicitly state:</p>

<pre><code>(2) Scrub all visible residue from the screen, inside walls of the basin, any
other removable parts, and the area behind them with a clean brush and liquid soap
and water.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>1. Is there a point to appeal this case? In particular - can the fine be reduced or waived by claiming that either the screen wasn't that dirty when inspector checked it or that the amount of fine is, in our opinion, too high for such a violation?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Can appealing lead to more trouble? I just checked myself that some of these regulations are subjective and very demanding. I am pretty sure that they could find some other things that they would not like and come up with extra fine for other things. Perhaps keeping low profile is better in this case?</strong></p>

      <TITLE>How does EU direct family have greater rights than extended family when the final outcome is going to be same for genuine cases?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I had asked some questions previously about EU Free movement rights like <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55474/rights-of-rejected-non-eu-extended-family-members-of-eu-citizens-for-achieving-a">this one</a>. I tried to extract answers by posing some scenarios but that proved to be inefficient. So I am trying a new way here to get the answer of the questions in my head.</p>
<p>I might have irritated some of you by now but trust me this question is really a proper question, so read it extremely carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Two</strong> types of EU family reunification are there---for direct family, and for extended family. It seems that extended family members have little legal weight for succeeding in an appeal in case their application is rejected (for whatever reason). BUT, I have found that whenever genuine applications for extended family members (as defined by EU law) have been refused, they eventually succeed in their appeal and the Court finally overturns the refusal and grants residence card.</p>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://sterling-law.co.uk/en/right-of-residence-granted-to-an-extended-family-member-of-eea-national-after-refusal-based-on-insufficient-evidence/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">UK case</a>
and <a href="https://berkeleysolicitors.ie/minister-ruled-to-have-been-incorrectly-applying-eu-law-relating-to-membership-of-the-same-household/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ireland case</a></p>
<p>In both cases the Court eventually found <strong>that the Minister wrongly refused residence application by stating that the evidence or documentation is insufficient</strong> while it was actually more than sufficient. This means that either such Minsters are deliberately doing that or they are incompetent, but it is likely that the former will be the case most of the times.</p>
<p>But anyway there is at least a right to appeal, even though extended family members have weaker rights in the courtroom than direct family members. At least they can <strong>reach</strong> the courtroom and in my opinion, that is all what is required, as the Court will definitely overturn a decision by the Minister <em><strong>which was wrongful</strong></em> (note that wrongful means that genuine cases and proper documentation was refused for some or the other reason(s)).</p>
<p>How do the rights of direct and extended family members differ when genuine cases with proper documentation always win in the end (be it directly, or after an appeal)? Extended family has weaker rights, but how? All genuine cases eventually win like the examples I provided above (Minister wrongfully stated that evidence was insufficient and the Court very well overturned that). In what way then, extended family members have weaker rights than Direct family members?</p>
<p>I know you would say that extended family do not have residence <strong>as a right</strong>, like direct family has, but that's not my point. My point is that although extended family members do not have it as their right, genuine cases always make their way into the EU. If the minister takes advantage of the fact that extended family does not have any legislative backing/support, and that their applications can be refused on whatever grounds they like, the minister wouldn't succeed in his mission as the Court would eventually overturn the wrong practice of not accepting genuine cases and proper evidence. So how does having a right differ from not having a right (direct vs extended) <em>when the final outcome is going to be the same for genuine cases with proper documentation/evidence?</em> <strong>I am asking <em>how does it differ?</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>PS</strong></em>: It is also not the case that Courts couldn't help extended family members because they don't have any European legislation for them. My examples clearly demonstrate that Courts <strong>do</strong> overturn decisions of ministers <strong>even though extended family has nothing</strong> <strong>as a right</strong> in EU law <em>simply because the Court will undo the illogical and unlawful</em>. Moreover, in the Irish case above, it is interesting to further note:</p>
<p><em>"The court does not consider that a approach by a decision-maker which amounts, in effect, to ‘Put in an application, I will not tell you even at the most general level, not even by way of non-binding guidance, what type of material I am looking for, but I will let you know if I do not see it’ is reasonable or entails fairness of procedure. It is unreasonable and unfair that the Minister should know what, at a general level, he is looking for when it comes to assessing applications generally, but will give no sense to applicants as to what it is that he is looking for, i.e. the unreasonableness/unfairness flows not from the Directive or the Regulations per se but from the closeted manner in which the Minister has elected to discharge his obligations to the detriment of applicants who, as a consequence of his approach, are unfailingly operating to some extent ‘in the blind’ when making an application such as that at issue here."</em></p>

<p>Real world example: a company is contracting a software development LLC for some development worked paid by the hour. The software development LLC wants to hire a tester via contract to test this software for a few hours. The softwere dev LLC pays their tester, then bills the hours the tester works on the client's project to their client. </p>

<p>I know that companies bill their clients for hours their on-payroll <strong>employees</strong> worked, but my question is specifically whether or not the hours of one contractor can be passed on by another to their client for working on the client's project.</p>

<p>A while back i went to buy Warhammer 40k but i couldn't play it because it required an internet connection despite  me using a single player campaign, so I took it back and got a refund (after successfully arguing that the package did not state that a net connection was required for single player which had no social connectivity to it, and that the packaging can be interpreted as referring only to the online mode).</p>

<p>However, imagine I brought the same game but as a Download Code from EB (a games shop and online retailer) and used it on Steam and was unable to play it because I need an internet connection for the single player campaign (despite needing the net to download it I am able to play The Ship in Steam just fine without a net connection).</p>

<p>Does the Australian Consumer Law entitle me to a refund? If so who do i inquire to to get my refund? Steam/Valve or EB Games</p>

<p>NOTE: Steam has the power to remove my game from the library but EB doesn't, however it was EB which I paid for the game not Steam.</p>

      <TITLE>Stuffed in the Fridge</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Los Angeles, August 1994.</p>
<p>Kyle Rayner returns home to his flat to find a note about a surprise in the fridge, signed A. The door to the same is left ajar. Inside he discovers the remains of his girlfriend, the photographer Alexandra DeWitt.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3NVtD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3NVtD.png" alt="Green Lantern (Volume 3) #54 (1994)" /></a></p>
<p>Autopsy shows that she was strangled to death and the body was forcefully made fit into the fridge post mortem. Other evidence points to a fight that had happened between the woman and her murderer, and Clifford Zmeck was encountered by Mr. Rayner at the scene. Mr. Zmek claims to be the perpetrator and threatens Mr. Rayner to "kill you nice and quick" for cooperating, implicating that he'd kill him anyway.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rayner and Zmek get into a fight, which destroys, among other things, a sizeable portion of Mr. Rayner's house.</p>
<p>Mr. Zmek is a US national and member of the airforce, convicted of murder and rape and sentenced to life in prison. In exchange for a pardon, he underwent experimental surgery in a federal experimental weapons program for the Vietnam War. During the experiment, he was outfitted with bombs under the skin. One such charge has led to the amputation of his left hand. After the lockdown of the program, Mr. Zmek became a mercenary. He was paid to extract an item from Mr. Rayner and information from Ms. DeWitt. We assume that this was not a governmental organization that paid him.</p>
<p><strong>Which variant of murder and what other charges can be brought against Mr. Zmek, assuming Mr. Rayner manages to detain him in a citizen's arrest?</strong></p>

      <TITLE>Hit and Run compensation UK</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This is going to be difficult to write, so I apologise if it's confusing at times.</p>

<p>About 6 years ago my wife was hit by a car when crossing the street (walking). The car wasn't going too fast (est. 40mph) but essentially turned the corner without indicating and was not looking at the road. After shouting at my wife (who was alone at the time) the man got back in his car and drove away. My wife called a friend from work (she was only 2 minutes outside) and they helped her to the A&E (probably another 2 minutes away luckily). My wife was seen by the doctors, notes were made, tests were done but she was released later that day. We called the police to report it and were told a police officer would come to our house to take a statement, but we were later called back and told we would have to come to a station and give a statement (at the time I mentioned it might be a while since my wife was in need of recovery). When we eventually got to the station to give our statement we were told we were too late, (it was about 10 weeks after). Before going to the station I had believed the 'case' had been opened but they were just waiting for my wife's statement to continue with it; the officer at the station told us that there was nothing they could do since any cameras near the scene of the hit and run wouldn't have their footage any more.</p>

<p>This was a let down, but the primary concern at the time was my wife's health - aside from being wheelchair bound by the incident she was also experiencing unexplained losses of consciousness. The long and short of this is a diagnostic process thay took years to identify a neurological condition that causes her to have 'episodes' of paralysis or loss of consciousness, among other conditions caused by the incident. Needless to say both my wife and I haven't been able to work since the incident - although I am officially her career and we recieve state benefits (PIP, carers allowance).</p>

<p>A little over a year ago one of my wife's doctors said there was a government scheme that handles things like hit and run compensation even if the driver was not caught, but unfortunately this has a 2 year timescale on it and we're outside of that.</p>

<p>It has just occured to me that I never found out when the 2 year counter starts from - is it the date of the accident? The date of the diagnosis? Is there any legal recourse that we could reasonably take this long after the incident to try and get our lives back on track?</p>

      <ID>30887</ID>
      <TITLE>Can I legally (but without license) sell merchandise with text and images based on a video game?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am setting up an online shop (or, say, a table/kiosk at conventions) to sell merchandise like t-shirts, mugs, etc, and I want to have merchandise with text and images either from or based on popular video game franchises. I would not be using the game logo or title of the game itself, but I would want to use specific images from inside the game (or the silhouette/likeness/"representing symbol" of characters in the game).</p>

<p>For example, a mug with a catch-phrase and logo from Mass Effect that says "I should go..." and "get a refill" on opposite sides with the <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Interrupt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Paragon/Renegade</a>/<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/kal-reegar/art/Paragade-185453578" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Paragade</a> logo on it.</p>

<p>As another example, maybe a headset with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Zelda franchise's Navi</a> on the earmuffs and "Hey! Listen!" printed across the band.</p>

<p>However I highly doubt I would be able to obtain a "merchandising license", or even get any form of response from a company like EA/BioWare or Nintendo if I inquire.</p>

<p>Am I opening myself up to possible lawsuits? Assuming yes, or that I would receive a "cease and desist" (because even on shaky legal ground I have no doubt a company would toss one at someone to hope they just complied), if I were sued (and leaving competency out of it) is there any sort of legal defense?</p>

<p>Clearly I have zero knowledge of parody/fair use/trademark/copyright (other than that the concepts exist), and I cannot afford a lawyer... so I'm sorry if this has been answered here before. I've found <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9448/can-i-make-fan-merchandise-and-sell-it">this question</a> and <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30440/how-well-can-characters-be-protected">these</a> <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30648/is-it-plagiarism-to-make-a-parody">ones</a> (could <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30776/who-has-ownership-and-rights-over-this-work">this one</a> even apply in any way? I dunno, that's why I'm here), but I'm hoping my case is different enough to not get downvoted into oblivion as I am not saying "I want to sell things that say 'Overwatch' and use the trademarked logo" and I don't know if using the content in this manner constitutes satirical/parody purposes of any kind.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatively</strong>, can I make any kind of promotional material (a poster, a video, take free pictures of people and digitally insert images, a free phone app) with likeness/symbols/images from their favourite video games? i.e. is there a significant difference between this and <em>directly monetizing</em>?</p>

<p>Sorry again. I anticipate the first comment being "get a lawyer" or "that's illegal", but any kind of elaboration would be amazing.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> I somehow missed the "Law Stack Exchange is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for individualized advice from a qualified legal practitioner" part until after clicking post, but if anyone is still able to advise me (educationally, of course) I would suuuuuuuper appreciate it.</p>

<p>Can your friend legally sell it back to you at a higher price, making some pocket money out of it ?</p>

<p>Now what if he's not a friend, but a stranger, or someone you got acquainted with online, is it considered contraband? (assuming everything is ok with customs at the airport).</p>

<p>Does it change anything if it's done between European Union countries?</p>

<p>Does it change anything if it's recurrent ? e.g. say this guys comes every month from Russia to France for unrelated business, each time he fills up his luggage with the maximum allowed amount of goods that comply with custom laws, and I buy them, giving him 15% of margin, is that OK?</p>

      <BODY><p>I first want to preface this by saying what I don't know regarding preliminary details:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't know whether there are public records of all the police officers and detectives working at a precinct.</li>
<li>I don't know how simple it is to find someone's address just from knowing their name. In my country, there are databases that give you someone's address just from knowing their name/phone number, <strong>if</strong> they allow that info to be public. Not sure if this is the case in the US.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, let's say I know Detective John Jameson works on a case about a serial killer, maybe because he questioned me in relation to the case. Am I allowed to spread this info?</p>
<hr />
<p>Motivation for asking:</p>
<p>I find the idea of having the identities of the investigators of a case known to be problematic; in some cases, wont this endager them, or the case, through making them a target of assassination or bribery/blackmail? Therefore, I could see there being a law prohibiting the spreading of this info. However, if that's the case, I would also think that they then were allowed to use fake badges when questioning witnesses, though I don't think that's legal (not sure).</p>
<p>On the other hand, a criminal investigation is a governmental affair, and thus I could see certain details of it being subject to requirements of public availability. Also, perhaps the addresses detectives and police officers aren't searchable in public databases, meaning this is a non-issue?</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what is info can legally be spread about the investigators of an active case?</p>

The issues were LGBT marriage, reproductive rights, and euthanasia.</p>

<p>The implication was that it did not matter whether I was on or off the job, or whether I was representing my workplace; if I held signs advocating for any of those things even on my own time and with no direct ties to the organization or church, my employment would or could be terminated.</p>

<p>Is this legal?</p>

      <BODY><p>The context here is a video game, which I won't name as it'd be a bit of a spoiler, but the relevant part of the plot is: The deuteragonist's boyfriend was guided and goaded to suicide by one of the antagonists, who gave full details on how to end his life, how to obtain the materials, etc, etc, etc. The story took place in England, but I'm looking for general viewpoints that would apply to multiple jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The deuteragonist went on a quest of vengeance, rather than seeking legal recourse. My question is: Had she been able to positively identify the person who did this, would he have been able to be charged with a crime? Or alternatively, would she have been able to sue him in civil court?</p>

<p>All the materials used were completely legal (I'm not 100% sure if the physics and chemistry actually work, but I'm not asking about that). There were significant difficulties in identifying the person behind the user name, which constitute a significant portion of the game's plot, but if there'd been anything definitely illegal happening, it would have been possible to bypass a lot of that via a subpoena to an ISP. But if what he did wasn't illegal, then the next question is: what is the legal status of a vengeance rampage against him? I suspect she may possibly have been opening <em>herself</em> up to some serious criminal charges.</p>

Can circumstantial/cumulative evidence be sufficient?</strong> One might immediately think of the almighty "beyond reasonable doubt" standard for criminal cases, but would this be necessary for justifying trials? If so, how could it be up to the judge alone to decide whether the standard is met if this is what trials exist for?</p>

<p><strong>Real use-case scenario:</strong></p>

<p>It is alleged that the defendant intentionally set his dog on a couple of pet animals, and/or recklessly let the dog attack them. One was killed, other seriously injured. The charges are under the Animal Welfare Act (<a href="http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0142/62.0/DLM50429.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">s28</a> and <a href="http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0142/62.0/DLM3094404.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">s28A</a>) and Dog Control Act (<a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0013/latest/DLM375410.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">s57(2)</a>).</p>

<p>Evidence:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A formal statement from a neighbour who:</p>

<p>a) From outside his house, saw the defendant and his vehicle near the pets (alive / non-injured);</p>

<p>b) Went into his house from where he soon heard an unusual noise;</p>

<p>c) Went out again and saw the defendant with a dog on the ground;</p>

<p>d) Saw the defendant put the dog in the vehicle and drive off;</p>

<p>e) Saw the killed and injured pets at the scene with injures looking like made by a dog.</p></li>
<li><p>Photos taken by myself soon after the incident, showing the dead pet with internal organs poking out of its ripped back, blood, some of the internal organs and external tissue on the ground.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Does this evidence meet the standard asked about above? (Note: this is not the main question; the main one is about the standard — in the bold above).</p>

<p>The charges were not accepted for filing with this "justification":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the witnesses did not actually witness any attack .. They heard an
  unusual noise ... There is no other evidence that the dog caused the
  injures... While it may be suspicious that the dog caused the death or
  injures, there is no evidence it did so, nor any evidence to discount
  another cause of the injury or death ... Neither of the ...
  [witnesses]  ... saw the defendant doing anything other than being
  near the scene.</p>

First off, does the "Google's TOS" actually mean it's for the Google company as a whole, or is this just for the search engine? They mention user accounts, which is part of their core to the ecosystem of Google Apps and such (Gmail, etc.), so what exactly is this TOS for? When do you agree to this?</p>

<p>Second, if the "Google's TOS" is all you need, why do you have the Chrome TOS? Do you need a TOS for every product you create? Or can one general one suffice?</p>

<p>Basically, should a downloadable mobile/desktop app have a TOS called "My Company TOS", or "My App TOS"? Or should the "My App TOS" include a link to the "My Company TOS" as a prereq? Or does just having the "My App TOS" suffice?</p>

      <TITLE>Can a college in Georgia be legally required to let you have equal opportunity to take an exam when their required 3rd party software causes issues?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Circumstances: I am a Sophomore at a University System of Georgia college, and am required to take Spanish for my degree. The professor requires students to purchase a license to 3rd party software in order to access all course content, instead of hosting the content on the provided college platform which has most needed capabilities. Start of the semester, I had to shell out about 100 bucks for the privilege of being able to access the course I already paid for. Part of the 3rd party software is testing that requires yet another browser extension for proctoring tests. One feature that this plugin has that the college-provided testing platform does not is that if it thinks you are attempting to exit the full screen proctoring page, after 30 seconds of continued attempts it will lock you out and end the exam.</p>
<p>The issue: I was taking my final on my family computer which I have taken other proctored tests on before without issue, and when I was mostly done, a pop-up windows notification came up, putting the window out of full screen. The page and computer froze since the laptop is not high end, and by the time it unfroze, 30 seconds had passed and the exam was closed. I emailed my instructor about it immediately, requesting that it be reopened, but the next morning I got a reply that it could not be reopened without resetting all progress on the exam, which was not an option. They sent me two of the remaining questions which were reading comprehension and let me answer those, but  other than that I cannot go back and finish the exam.</p>
<p>I am worried that I might fail the class due to the weight the exam grade holds, and at the very least I think my grade will be significantly impacted for the worse. Are they legally required to give me an equal opportunity as other students to finish the exam, since it was their software that they forced us to purchase that had an issue which I couldn't control?</p>

      <BODY><p>Can any citizen of NH legally carry any knife, gun (black powder or modern) or any weapon on a sidewalk next to a any school in NH? I know on duty police officers can carry weapons, and there are exceptions for people who have authorization to give presentations and other exceptional circumstances. I'm not interested in an affirmative defense. I want to know if there is a way to transport a weapon in a school zone for an adult under everyday circumstances that allows the weapon to be accessible as opposed to locked in the trunk and disassembled. </p>

<p>Is there any adult of the private sector who can gain the "privilege" of the second amendment within a school zone? According to the article on school zones by <a href="https://www.concealedcarry.com/law/defining-gun-free-school-zones-act/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">USCCA</a> we are led to believe there is no <em>federal</em> law prohibiting licensed gun owners from exercising the 2nd amendment right. I don't know if there are other federal restrictions like if such a person can carry openly or concealed, if the restriction applies more strictly to muskets and other black-powder-only weapons, if knives are still illegal to carry <em>normally</em> on a sidewalk near the school, etc. Also, the article doesn't clarify if NH has any laws against bearing arms on or near schools. </p>

<p>Another way to ask the question is what can a person with a concealed carry permit carry everyday, and how can it be carried, on a walk along a public sidewalk next to a school? </p>

      <TITLE>Is modifying a song's audio using youtube's Phase Vococer to slow it down to 0.25% a copyright violation?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>On the surface, this seems like a simple question. At quick glance, you might immediately say: "Yes, changing the speed of a song is a derivative work". </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_(law)" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a>, a transformed work is possibly viewed as fair use: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In United States copyright law, transformation is a possible
  justification that use of a copyrighted work may qualify as fair use,
  i.e., that a certain use of a work does not infringe its holder's
  copyright due to the public interest in the usage. Transformation is
  an important issue in deciding whether a use meets the first factor of
  the fair-use test, and is generally critical for determining whether a
  use is in fact fair, although no one factor is dispositive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it is completely clear that simply speeding up or slowing down a song, which would change both the pitch and speed, is clearly a derivative work. My question is regarding transforming it using youtube's speed controls. </p>

<p>Youtube's speed algorithm uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_vocoder" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="phase vocoder">phase vocoder</a>. When the speed of a song is lowered to 0.25 it is virtually unrecognizable as the original work due to the effects the phase vocoder introduces to the original audio. The phase vocoder works by <strong>transforming</strong> the audio, which seems to match the legal language around what is considered fair use. In fact, the basis for a phase vocoder is a mathematical transformation  function called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Short-time Fourier Transform">Short-time Fourier transform</a>. </p>

<p>In youtube's speed control algorithm, while the pitch is retained, the duration of the notes is altered, and the effect of of the phase vocoder on slowing the video to 0.25 adds audio effects that transforms even the color of the notes to the point that it's difficult to tell what instrument is being played. </p>

<p>Further, once this transformation is performed on the audio, if a recording is made of the audio in this state, returning it to the original speed is a near impossibility. </p>

<p>Also, the reason I'm asking this overall, is I would like to do this and then add several layers of tracks of different instruments and effects to the song, which could be considered criticism or parody perhaps? </p>

  <p>Is the proposed Brexit agreement contrary to the Human Rights Act?</p>

<p>May's Brexit Deal as it is currently tabled, sees EU laws continue to apply in the UK, enforced by the Commission and Adjudicated by the ECJ.  However under Article 7 the UK is excluded from</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the nomination, appointment or election of members of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, as well as the participation in the decision-making and the attendance in the meetings of the institutions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theresa May envisages the transition period continuing up to 2022, but it could go on for any length of time.  Moreover, the EU would have right of veto over the UK's exit from the Northern Ireland protocol.</p>

<p>Immediately there would appear to be problems with the UK's Human Rights Act 1998:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No discrimination: everyone’s rights are equal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet clearly, an EU citizen living in the UK will enjoy superior rights of determination in respect of having democratic rights to determine the UK laws which govern them while UK subjects would not.</p>

<p>Then we have the right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The right to free elections: elections must be free and fair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, if we take as given what goes to election and who may participate, this is not threatened.  But if we take as a premise that fairness as aright extends to the right to participate in elections, surely the deal is starting to look illegal, is it not?</p>

      <TITLE>Is a presidential self pardon more likely to be valid if issued to a group instead of the president as an individual</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>My understanding is, the presidential pardon power is based on this passage of the US constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for
Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of impeachment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/one-word-bars-trump-pardoning-himself/617170/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read</a> that one issue* with the uncertainty about the legality/validity of presidential self pardons is the word "grant" wasn't really used in the context of "grant myself" at the time the constitution was written.</p>
<p>But the pardon power can also apply to entire groups of people. And the president can belong to a group. Based on this, would a presidential pardon become more likely to be legal/valid if it applied to a group of people that included the president, instead of just to the individual? Even if the group was very small and the attempt rather transparent (e.g. "the Trump family", or "current and former Presidents of the United States of America")?</p>
<hr />
<p>*I'm aware that this is not the only issue, and a possible answer is that the "grant" issue is dwarfed by more relevant legal arguments.</p>

      <TITLE>Under what circumstances is it lawful or unlawful for police to disclose one's information to third parties, e.g. complainants?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Is it basically neither prohibited nor required and thus entirely to police discretion as to whether or not to disclose parties' details to either their purported victims, or to other parties like journalists? Isn't that a breach of someone's privacy rights? I've been wrongly accused of assault by fascist protest groups before, who have called the police, who have collected my details to screen for warrants. This seems like a legitimate use of and reason for collecting my information. I explicitly requested them not to let the fascist protestors have my name and details because I feared persecution and harassment. Why is it not a GDPR/DPR violation for them to give the fascists information which I would resolutely and rightfully deny to them if they asked me for it directly? (Indeed, they had demanded my details on previous occasions and I certainly did deny them that.) I can understand if I was already convicted or even charged, (as court proceedings are necessarily public) or just arrested to be charged, as that at least implies some necessary level of merit to the accusations, but how is it not violation of my privacy rights when I should be presumed innocent of any wrongdoing until demonstrated otherwise?</p>
<p>Luckily the police assured me that they wouldn't give my details to my adversaries in that case but what is the legal standing of my request to the police for privacy from adversaries?</p>

<p>It seems that to me if it weren't for the fact that one takes physical action to acquire the drivers license it would be in contradiction to the 4th amenent. </p>

<p>So if say this law applied for non drivers license, requiring one to have a valid ID, as well as current address, then this would be in violation, as given no other premises than the existence of a person and no further physical action a person would automatically be in violation and thus in plainest assumptions a person is not protected from seizure. </p>

      <TITLE>Can an ISP respond to a DMCA counter notice on behalf of a user?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>We are an ISP, allowing our users to write reviews of their educational experience.  Normally the users' free speech rights are protected through the Communications Decency Act, Anti-SLAPP statutes, first amendment, etc. all that.</p>

<p>Lately though, a entity's CEO/Owner filed a DMCA request against us and a very negative review about him and his school in particular, claiming copyright ownership over it.  We can claim to be an ISP and gain those restrictions, but as the review is anonymous (we have the IP though), we have no way to contact the author.  Furthermore, the DMCA request is clearly false/perjurious -- for several reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>The CEO did not write such a scathing negative review of himself in the third person and then decide to submit it to us anonymously, only to request the takedown.  Clearly he is not the copyright owner.</li>
<li>The CEO has contacted (harassed) us many times (email and letters) concerning this and other reviews, claiming defamation, slander, trademark infringement, and anything else he could think of.  Clearly the review is not his. </li>
<li>We know his IP addresses and the IPs of his staff based upon the emails, of which other false (positive) reviews were submitted.</li>
<li>The review authors grant us copyright to use their reviews, via a disclaimer on the survey itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>We normally have a process for the review authors to remove their own reviews, which other reviewers use.  We also have a process for entities to dispute the validity of reviews, which other entities use and have used successfully.  But we generally reserve the right to decide if a review is valid via process, and this DMCA takedown is putting us into the awkward position of forcing us to choose between being an "ISP" or a "content author/submitter".  If we choose not to play the ISP part in responding, then it seems that we open ourselves up to suit as a defamatory content author.</p>

<p>Basically, can we preserve our DMCA- ISP "immunity" and still respond on behalf of the review author?</p>

<p>Edit: I guess basically I am asking a sidestep question.  What do we do when WE have the information that demonstrates that the content is non-infringing, and that the DMCA filer is plainly lying?  Apart from signing an affidavit (and releasing his/her identity), the original author has no way to prove that he/she is the original author either.  And it is really beside the point, since the entity is trying to get negative reviews removed, not protect a copyright of something they own.  I mean, it is clear abuse of the system.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Though my question is pointedly what I am dealing with, perhaps it should be revised to a more simple question.  For instance, what do you do if you are an ISP who receives a DMCA for content YOU own, and YOU produced, and YOU exclusively hold the copyright for.  Do you have to take down <strong>your own content</strong> until you send a counter notice, and record the counternotice to yourself?  So upstream ISPs have forwarded the DMCA to you to handle (because you own all of the servers and power and colocation facility).</p>

<p>There's this built-in assumption in the DMCA which is that the one filing the takedown is actually the copyright holder, and all they have to do is sign a BS lying affidavit, certifying that they believe it to be theirs, which carries very little consequence, and then at that point the onus is upon everyone else to either show they are not involved, or give up the personal information of the owner to a potentially litigiously malicious party.  For instance, the information that the DMCA counter notice demands, would otherwise not be provided without subpoena.  </p>

      <BODY><p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>I am working on a language app to learn languages, and I was thinking to include sentences and dialogues for the users to practice their languages. 
My question is: can I re-use, and to what extend, similar exercises used in other textbooks?
Does that fall under the fair use for educational purpose?</p>
<p>And more in particular, I am wondering about the following 3 cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Are vocabulary lists for specific lessons copyrighted?
I know a single word (e.g. in Latin) + translation in English is not copyrighted, but what about whole series of words as vocabulary list?
E.g.: can I add to the "lesson 1" of my app the vocabulary list at the end of chapter one of a hypothetical book "learn Latin in 20 lessons"?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What about dialogues, especially very basic ones, like "What is your name? My name is Paul. Where are you from? I am from Canada"? are they copyrighted? or it depends, and how can I determine the threshold?</p>
</li>
<li><p>The app will focus mainly on ancient, dead languages, like Latin. I guess that sentences taken from ancient texts can be used freely as exercises. But what about basic sentences created by the author of a teaching book to illustrate specific examples? Or sentences from the initial exercises, which often are made up to illustrate specific grammatical concepts?
Are those sentences copyrighted, or again could I use the sentences of the exercise at the end of chapter one of the same hypothetical book "learn Latin in 20 lessons" ?</p>

<p>So for each individual crime there is reasonable doubt as to Alice's guilt, but the totality of the cases are such that it is extremely unlikely that she didn't commit at least several acts of theft (although we cannot say for certain which ones).</p>
<p><strong>Is there a name for situations like these?</strong> And if it's not too broad of a question: <strong>how are they handled?</strong></p>

      <TITLE>Why is the Queen of Canada known as Elizabeth II?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>The regnal numbers of the monarchy of the United Kingdom are combined from the regnal numbers of the separate kingdoms of England and Scotland. Hence, as there was a previous Queen Elizabeth in England, the current queen is known as Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is a common mistake to call her the Queen of England: she is not, as England is no longer a kingdom in its own right, but instead forms part of the singular United Kingdom.</p>

<p>However, Canada, Australia, and Jamaica, among others, <em>are</em> kingdoms in their own right, with their own monarchies (which merely happen to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union" rel="noreferrer">vested in the same person</a>). Elizabeth is not Queen of England, but she <em>is</em> Queen of Canada, Queen of Australia, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_headed_by_Elizabeth_II" rel="noreferrer">queen of many other countries</a>.</p>

<p>In these countries, why is she known as Elizabeth II? Elizabeth I of England never ruled any of these countries.</p>

      <TITLE>How strict should I be with "to the best of my knowledge"?</TITLE>
      <BODY><h2>The Question:</h2>

<p>In many legal documents, there is a section for you to sign where you declare that the document is correct to the best of your knowledge.  If something small or relatively unimportant is incorrect in the document, would you sign it?</p>

<h2>Some Context:</h2>

<p>I'm completing a loan application where both I and my wife are joint applicants.  Included in the document is a table showing our current debts, which is mostly our mortgage.  The table also has a mark on each row indicating if the debt belongs to the primary applicant (me) or the "other" applicant (my wife) and then a "total", which is the sum of all the debts.  For some reason, the table lists the mortgage for me, and then again for my wife, so the total is about 2x what it should be (a large sum).  I informed the loan officer that this was incorrect and did not reflect the actual debt that we carry.  They indicated that they cannot change it because the table is auto-populated using data pulled from our credit report and the mortgage is listed twice because both of our names are on the mortgage.  Instead they countered that many people sign this and that it isn't all that important because I'm just disclosing my debt.  So I offered to not sign that portion since it was so unimportant.  They obviously would not allow that.</p>

<p>I understand that the purpose of this section was to say "hey, here's all my debts, I'm not stretching myself too thin."  So if my reported debt is high and the bank is willing to give me a loan anyway, then this section of the document shouldn't matter to me.  However, I don't feel comfortable signing a legal document saying "this is all correct" when I know it isn't correct.  Am I being unrealistic?</p>

      <TITLE>What is a binary form in software BSD license (and other licenses that didn't define it)?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>BSD license says (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redistribution and use in <strong>source and binary forms</strong>, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds "binary form" refers to the form of software in which the content is just an array of 1's and 0's, which are, after all, "binary".</p>
<p>But what about the output form that is not exactly 1's and 0's? For instance, JavaScript files get minified/uglified in a "bundling process" (a usual step in website and JS library building), the output isn't exactly 1's and 0's, but very-difficult-to-read files, for example:</p>
<pre><code>!function(a,b){"object"==typeof module&&"object"==typeof module.exports?module.exports=a.document?b(a,!0):function(a){if(!a.document)throw new Error("jQuery requires a window with a document");return b(a)}:b(a)}("undefined"!=typeof window?window:this,function(a,b){var c=[],d=a.document,e=c.slice,f=c.concat,g=c.push,h=c.indexOf,i={},j=i.toString,k=i.hasOwnProperty,l={},m="1.12.4",n=function(a,b){return new n.fn.init(a,b)},o=/^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g,p=/^-ms-/,q=/-([\da-z]
</code></pre>
<p>Are these output files covered by the definition of "binary form" of the BSD license?</p>
<p>Another example is raw HTML, CSS, and textual files - after "bundling", they usually stay more or less the same as the source. Are they covered by the definition of "binary form" in the BSD license?</p>
<p>This is a hypothetical question to test the robustness of the license's wording.</p>

      <TITLE>How does the US legal system prevent successful evidence tampering from reducing total punishment?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Flavor text:</p>

<p>You're suddenly startled by the feds knocking on your door. Someone must have squealed about the methamphetamine operation you've picked up as a hobby to try and save some money for your family. You quickly Google the punishment for evidence tampering and find <a href="https://www.wklaw.com/tampering-with-witnesses-or-evidence/" rel="noreferrer">some law firm's webpage</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under U.S. Code 18 Section 1519, federal evidence tampering can be
  charged as a felony and is punishable by up to 20 years in federal
  prison and a fine of up to $250,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn't sound so bad compared to the life sentence you would surely face as the convicted kingpin of a meth empire. Before opening the door and welcoming in the DEA, you quickly destroy documents that are crucial for a successful conviction. How does the US federal legal system deal with such a scenario?</p>

<hr>

<p>Does the US legal system have <em>specific mechanisms</em> to ensure that evidence tampering does not allow one to reduce total punishment? As examples, can proof of evidence tampering be used as evidence of the original crime? Can a sentence for evidence tampering somehow scale to be at least as great as any crime it successfully covers up?</p>

<p>Alternatively, are there scenarios in the US legal system where destroying evidence could be the rational thing to do (assuming you will succeed in covering up the original crime but be convicted of evidence tampering)?</p>

<p>Assume US federal law.</p>

Now I've got some questions regarding the indentation and whitespace formatting as well as the displaying in general.</p>

<p>Often legal texts are already kind of preformatted. They are having a fixed width and word-wrapped paragraphs.</p>

<p>If I would display them in my software for several display devices (mobile phones/tablets/desktop pcs), the text field would word-wrap them again and lead to strange formatting (underful lines and too many line breaks).</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I allowed to undo the word-wrapping of all the texts and unindent them, as well as performing a new word-wrap on them?</li>
<li>Do I have to make sure that it is readable for everyone on every device, and do I have to make sure that accessibility interfaces are used (e.g. for blind persons, which aren't even the target group of my software)?</li>
<li>Do I have to make sure, that if my application wouldn't even start correctly on a device, that the user is able to start the application in an impossible, absurd, magic or religious way to ensure that he can read the legal texts or is it enough to state it on the website then?</li>
<li>Do I have to make sure that the rendering of the licenses/privacy policy/impressum is performant (e.g. text rendering and refresh after scrolling takes less than a second)? I already have to include two external libraries with my software to display the texts, otherwise it would not be possible to display texts at all.</li>

      <TITLE>Evil mother filed missing person report after kicking out adult daughter. Any way to dismiss it?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Alright, so my girlfriend and I were planning to move in together sometime next month. We've been in a long distance relationship for over 2 years and have never met in person until now. She was in Oregon and me in California.</p>

<p>To make this easier for everyone, I kept advising her to tell her parents in advance so I can meet them beforehand. Unfortunately, they suddenly went berserk and decided to kick her out one random day at 3am after her mother failed to catfish me the night before. She was able to beg for extra time so they let her stay until evening that day. That day, her mother kept yelling and breaking her things (shattered phone as evidence) as well as spilling water on her boxes she had prepared to move out.</p>

<p>When she told me about this that morning, I immediately skipped work and went on a 17-ish hour long non-stop road trip to pick her up. She has just turned 18 last month and did not have a job so she would've probably ended up on the streets. She still had her laptop to talk to me so I was able to call her a taxi for a nearby Motel. With the money she had, she was only able to afford up to 2 nights there.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got there at 2am and we left to California the next morning. Now we're finding out that her mother tried messaging the phone she broke and accusing me of kidnapping her daughter. We know she's crazy so, for our safety, we refuse to disclose our location but she did take selfies, videos, and even called her over the phone to prove that she's fine. Even then, she filed a missing person report and we're being tracked down. They already found records of places we stayed and visited.</p>

<p>What can we do to dismiss such report? Does she just show up at a local police department telling them that she's fine and it was her own decision? </p>

<p>Her mother said the police also wanted to talk to me separately. I do not want to get involved in this at all. Can I reject it? Can we file chargers to her mother for being so abusive? Would I get in trouble for being in a relationship with her daughter since I was 20 and she was 16? We had never met in person until now, to avoid any trouble. She's short which makes her look a lot younger than she is. She did bring her Oregon driving permit and birth certificate as proof of her age. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I'm part of the DACA program so I fear this may put my work authorization at risk. I really love my fiancee and do not want to be separated from her...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This Court has held that a few important rights—“to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal”—may be waived only with the client’s consent. Jones, 463 U.S. at 751. But “[w]ith the exception of these specified fundamental decisions, an attorney’s duty is to take professional responsibility for the conduct of the case, after consulting with his client.” Jones, 463 U.S. at 753 n.6. In Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175 (2004), the Court declined to add contesting guilt at the guilt phase of a capital trial to that list.
  Nixon concluded that strategically conceding guilt in a capital case is not “the equivalent of a guilty plea” and may be defense counsel’s wisest course. Id. at 189- 191. As the Court explained, <strong>a “guilty plea is ‘more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts,’ it is a ‘stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced.’”</strong> Id. at 188 (quoting Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969)). A “plea is not simply a strategic choice; it is itself a
  31
  conviction.” Id. at 187 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<li>If it's not forbidden under state law, could it be forbidden by individual counties, towns, districts, or schools?</li>

<h1>Potential Complications</h1>

<ul>
<li>Privacy.  Some students might be fine with registering, but not with telling me.</li>
<li>Citizenship.  Some of my students might be undocumented, or might be on a foreign exchange.</li>
<li>Age.  I know you can register if you're going to be 18 before election day, but some of my students might just miss the cutoff.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assumptions and Facts</h1>

<ul>
<li>It's a public school.</li>
<li>I'd prefer to give out forms and have my students fill them out in class that day, but I could live without it.</li>
<li>I know exactly as much about my student's age and citizenship as I'm legally allowed to know.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what offices are on the next ballot.</li>

      <BODY><p>I'm working on bylaws for an organization and I'm having a hard time parsing out the details of the term "members present and voting" as described in various sections of <em>Roberts Rules of Order, Newly Revised</em>.</p>
<p>I do understand the general purpose in that it prevents abstentions from counting as negative votes. I wonder, though, if it could have unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Given a bylaws article which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all issues to be voted on shall be decided by a simple majority of qualified members present and voting at the meeting in which the vote takes place, provided a quorum is present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an extreme hypothetical situation: at a meeting where there is a quorum present, there are 50 members qualified to vote in attendance. An issue comes up for a vote, and 45 people abstain, 3 vote yes, 2 vote no.</p>
<p>Would this pass 3 to 2, or is there some overriding part of "majority present and voting" that I am just not understanding?</p>

      <TITLE>Does legality of an computerized action depend on user location or computer location?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Now of days it's quite easy to have a computer in a completely different part of the world from where I'm located that I'm working on.  This makes me wonder how 'criminality' is defined if the laws of my home country differ from the country the computer is in.  I'm wondering at what point the location of a server/computer decide the laws that apply to it and at what point it's the location of the user that matters.</p>

<p>To give some examples, not so much expecting answers to all of the below so much as explaining my confusion of distinction in case it informs an answer.</p>

<p>For example, lets say I choose to view material that is not legal for me to view in my home state (copyright material I haven't payed for, some type of outlawed pornography, some sort of state secret I'm not suppose to see etc), but which is legal to view in the country in which some server I connect to is located.  I'm pretty sure I've committed a crime, even if the computer providing the data is illegal, but is this only because the data was copied to my computer?  If I use some VNC technology that shows me the screen of another computer located outside of the US to view this data without any of it stored or cached on my computer, am I still committing a crime (I think so?)</p>

<p>On the other hand I see servers located outside of the US doing things that would be illegal in the US, online gambling, 'spamming' people, selling things without paying US taxes etc.  Can I connect to a server for any reason and still be legal?  If amazon want's to have a server in some country X and pay that countries taxes instead of US taxes can someone from the US still connect to that server to do anything at all with it without suddenly being guilty of violating a law because that server isn't abiding by US law?</p>

<p>If it's the location of the user that matters then does that mean I can use a computer outside the US to do something that is illegal in <em>that</em> country?  If I'm in the US and using a cloud computer hosted in say the UK and for some reason I end up doing something with that computer that is 100% legal in the US but isn't legal in UK (maybe some data is allowed to view here that isn't there?) have I broken the law in UK?  If I happen to travel to UK at some later date could a zealous prosecute arrest me because of the location of my computer?   (I realize this last question is probably comes down to "it depends on the country", but generally speaking for countries that practice common law is there a consensus that most countries agree on?)</p>

      <BODY><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">recent presidential decree</a> banning immigrants from certain nations refers to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187" rel="nofollow noreferrer">8 USC 1187(a)(12)</a>, identifying aliens "from countries referred to in" that piece of law, which explicitly names Syria and Iraq as being on the list. The law also states that other countries might be put on the list, but does not name others. The decree itself does not list any specific countries as being on the banned list, but there seems to be media agreement that the list of seven includes Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen; it also does not include Cuba or North Korea. The relevant pieces of US Code indicate that the Secretaries of State or Homeland Security might maintain such lists, but I can't find clear and current evidence of any such list from which these nations could be identified. The list of countries seems to closely correspond to earlier versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Sponsors_of_Terrorism" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"State Sponsors of Terrorism"</a> list, but omits North Korea and includes states which were formerly but are not currently on the list.</p>

<p>Is there any currently-valid government list which identifies Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen (and optionally Iraq and Syria), and no other countries, in a fashion that can be subsumed under the provisions of 8 USC 1187(a)(12)? And, of course, a legally-authoritative source of the list would be needed. </p>

      <TITLE>Personal devices subject to subpoena?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I work for a company in the US in IT, and don't have a company provided phone.  I've resisted installing work-related apps on my phone (such as Skype/Teams, Outlook) out of concern that my phone might be subpoenaed in the event that there is a legal issue at work (and thus I wouldn't have my personal phone for some period of time). Things like the opposing counsel wanting to look at all communications, and so subpoenaing devices that the communication might have occurred on.</p>
<p>I'm wondering, were the company I work for to become embroiled in litigation where I had some peripheral involvement (such as did work on a project that was the subject of litigation, but wasn't primary or accused of fault):</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming I am using apps like Teams and Outlook, apps that interact with the work servers, does having those connections on my phone cause it to be possible to subpoena my phone (as opposed to just the information from the server, which is much less troublesome)</li>
<li>If I do <em>not</em> use those apps, but do use my phone for 2FA (two factor authentication) at work (as I'm required to), either via a 2FA app or text messages, would that still mean my phone might be subpoenaed (so installing teams/outlook doesn't make it any worse)?</li>

      <TITLE>Do international sanctions have an impact on Open Source Software?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Recently I was reading about embargoes and sanctions on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_sanctions_against_Iran" rel="noreferrer">Iran</a> (also this <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/index.htm" rel="noreferrer">link</a>) and before <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/sudan.aspx" rel="noreferrer">Sudan</a>, and it got me thinking about how they could impact Open Source Software. Sanctions being applied not only by USA but sometime by other states and unions of countries (EU for example).</p>

<p>I know that equipment from, say, an American manufacturer, could not be supplied to North Korea (for example an Oracle Server or a Cisco router) pending legal action. Thus i wondered if there was anything that restricted the use of an American made Open Source Software in say, North Korea.</p>

<p><strong>What I understood</strong></p>

<p>On the <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#evil" rel="noreferrer">Open Source Initiative website</a>, they state that :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Can I stop "evil people" from using my program?</strong></p>
  
  <p>No. The Open Source Definition specifies that Open Source licenses may not discriminate against persons or groups. Giving everyone
  freedom means giving evil people freedom, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notion of "good people" and "evil people" is beyond the scope of this question, but this tells me that anybody, anywhere could in fact use it without any troubles at all (talking about only the <strong>usage</strong> of the software).
However, naively, even if I would see the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" rel="noreferrer">MIT License</a> as an Open Source License, I see it as well, naively, as a License created under US Law by an American Institution (MIT License).</p>

<p>My question is divided as this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can developers from a state under such sanction, use Open Source Software as they want ?</li>
<li>Could developers of the Open Source Software be sued for the use of their creation by the states under sanction ?</li>
<li>If a team of developers of another country were to help the developers to use the Open Source Software (support, online help etc.), could they face legal action ?</li>

<p>In cybersecurity, there's a term called responsible disclosure. In essence, you notify the company of a vulnerability and give them  plenty of time to take care of it.

      <BODY><p>Say someone is on trial for a murder they committed. During the trial, one of the witnesses, a friend of the defendant, admits that it was actually they who were the killer. It seems that this would be enough to create reasonable doubt and get an acquittal, or even possibly have the state drop the charges because they now believe that they should be charging this other person.</p>

<p>After the trial ends, the friend presents irrefutable proof that they weren't actually the murderer. Of course, this friend could be charged with perjury, obstruction, etc... but the original defendant can't be re-tried for the murder because of double jeopardy, and their friend can't be tried (or won't be found guilty) because of the evidence that he didn't do it.</p>

<p>Is there a flaw in this system? Something that prevents someone from actually doing this?</p>

      <BODY><p>My energy company have estimated the opening meter readings for my move in date for a property. </p>

<p>I have the correct readings in photos taken on that date, but the energy company won't allow me to submit those readings since their terms and conditions state that the readings have to be submitted within a week of the account opening, and I missed that date.</p>

<p>Article 16 of the GDPR gives me the right to correct any personal information held on me by a company.</p>

<p>Estimated meter readings are incorrect by definition and so they should constitute "Incorrect personal information held on me by a company" which I should have the legal right to rectify.</p>

<p>Does article 16 of the GDPR supersede their policy of only allowing meter readings to be submitted within 7 days?</p>

<p>Article 16 states that they can only refuse for a limited set of reasons like for example if the request is only to cause annoyance or is repeated, which doesn't apply here. </p>

<p>Article 16 doesn't say for example "You may refuse if your terms and conditions say so", so the fact that I accepted their terms and conditions should be overridden and not applicable.</p>

<p>The previous tenants didn't provide meter readings for over a year, so the estimate calculated is pretty far off.</p>

Suspect admits to crime.
Victim does not press charges.

      <TITLE>If Marbury v Madison was overturned, would this eliminate Judicial Review in the United States?</TITLE>
      <BODY><h1>Background</h1>

<p>Marbury V. Madison established the practice of Judicial review in the United States, though the principle existed before the case.  This gave the Supreme Court power to invalidate laws, or portions of laws, that it found unconstitutional.  By the same token, it limited the Supreme Court to a court of appeals with respect to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/5us137" rel="noreferrer">writs of mandamus</a> and not as a court with original jurisdiction on the matter.</p>

<p>Marbury v. Madison, like any other Supreme Court case, is subject to being overturned either by the Supreme Court, or by amendment to the constitution.  If this were to happen, that means the Judicial Act of 1789 regains full force of the law, and presumably the power to issue writs of Mandamus with original jurisdiction. But there is another part of the case that led me to ask this question...</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>If Marbury v Madison was overturned, thereby reinstating in full the Judicial Act of 1789, does this also mean that the Surpeme Court loses the power of Judicial review?  And, if so, does this loss of power apply to all cases where it has been applied?</p>

<p>I've done a bit of research and found that it seems like name changing, baby registration, (and maybe immigration?) are state specific forms, though do have to be followed by a federal request to get your social security card.</p>

<p>All of the state specific forms and the social security forms I've been able to find don't have any information on what is allowable characters.  They are all forms to be printed out and hand filled in so presumably any character you can write legibly can be submitted, though, presumably, may not be accepted.</p>

<p>The only information I was able to find was california only allows the 26 letters and don't even allow accents or anything else.  But that doesn't really answer the questions for other states or for social security.  I would assume that the printers/software/process used to print out social security cards would only allow a specific set of characters that is probably far shot of all of Unicode, but I can't validate that.  I understand the answer might be different by state, so don't expect an answer that covers all 50 states, though it seems like the social security answer would override other answers.</p>

      <TITLE>USAMRIID is US Military - are they allowed to deploy domestically contrary to Posse Comitatus in response to biological outbreaks?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This is a question that was raised after watching several TV series on streaming services.  It revolves around the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and activity of USAMRIID on US Soil and whether legally they can be deployed or can act within the United States in the event of a major viral outbreak or other type of situation where they and their scientists are the 'front lines' of a major Biosafety Level 3/4 outbreak domestically.</p>
<p><strong>Origin of the Question</strong></p>
<p>A 1995 movie called "Outbreak" details a fictional viral outbreak of an infinitely lethal pathogen.  This pathogen essentially infects an entire town and USAMRIID and US Military are deployed to cordon off the town and act alongside CDC to help identify and then attempt to create an antigen for this fictional pathogen.  However, there was a US Army military cordon used in the movie to isolate the affected town.</p>
<p>Two seasons of a series called "The Hot Zone" exist (<em>based</em> on actual real life events, i.e. Ebola Reston and Amerithrax responses and investigations), the first one detailing the Ebola Reston situation where there was an Ebola outbreak in Reston at an animal quarantine place holding monkeys.  USAMRIID deployed during that first season to sterilize the facility, neutralize the monkeys, and get samples of Ebola Reston to USAMRIID for study.  They operated as a military operation to get in, sterilize the threats, and get out without being seen, however as everyone involved was USAMRIID, they were technically military, so it stands to reason they are not permitted to deploy domestically.</p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>
<p>We know that the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385) limits the ability for the federal government to deploy US military personnel to enforce domestic laws and policies within the US.  However, while USAMRIID is a US Military operation out of Fort Detrick, there still seems to be a lot of movies showing USAMRIID deploying in response to domestic biosafety level 3 and level 4 situations, adn then in turn acting in regards to those situations.</p>
<p>I know these movies are dramatizations, and not based in actual US legal cases at times, however I know that USAMRIID along with CDC personnel were involved in eradicating the Ebola Reston 'outbreak' before it spread beyond the quarantine facility.</p>
<p>Does USAMRIID operate outside the Posse Comitatus Act, in that they can coordinate and act on US soil in response to biological threat situations, or are they bound by Posse Comitatus and are not allowed to act to enforce biosafety in the event of outbreaks of BL4 agents like ebola or other filoviruses?</p>
<p><strong>This question is looking for answers based in law and precedent related to Posse Comitatus and whether it affects USAMRIID specific activities states-side in response to biosafety situations.</strong>  Precedents to support statements are desired in this case.</p>

      <TITLE>Do you have to evict someone who was staying with you without contract or lease, but left without warning?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Hypothetical Scenario:</strong> A 19 year old "friend of a friend of a friend" type situation that someone was trying to help out. He was living in a rundown trailer a few towns away so a nice family said he could stay with them for a bit and they'd help him get established in the nice family's town.</p>
<p>After a few weeks he got a job at Walmart. Two days before he was supposed to start he just left the nice family. He moved in with someone else about a hundred miles away.  He left all his stuff at the nice family's house, which just consists of a few boxes and some motorcycle parts.  It would all fit in a truck.</p>
<p>The Nice Family offered to bring the stuff to him but he said he wouldn't help unload it.</p>
<p>The nice family is being told that they must go through the eviction process.  I know <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2081/if-a-tenant-moves-in-without-a-signed-lease-must-the-landlord-go-through-the-ev">questions like this</a> confirm, possibly, but is the nice family's situation different?</p>
<p>Can the nice family tell the 19 year-old that all his stuff is in their barn and he has 30 days to come get it?  If he doesn't, they will sell it and keep the money? (While the 19 year-old was with the nice family, they paid hundreds of dollars for things like getting his car out of impound, not to mention food and other stuff.)</p>
<p>Thoughts? Other info needed?</p>
<p>I tagged this landlord even though I feel like they did not have a "tenant-landlord relationship", legally or otherwise.</p>

      <TITLE>Are Harvard-style open access policies lawful under civil law?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access" rel="noreferrer">The open access movement</a> tries to make scholarly articles freely available online, to move away from the traditional model where publishers charge access to the articles. To support this movement, universities implement open access policies, requiring researchers to make their works freely available.</p>

<p><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Drafting_a_policy#Types_of_policy" rel="noreferrer">Open access policies such as that of Harvard or MIT</a> are implemented by granting the university some non-exclusive rights on the works written by faculty. This is very useful as it circumvents subsequent copyright transfers (to some extent).</p>

<p>There are a few articles explaining why this is compatible with copyright law, so in common law (see below). I wonder whether similar policies could be designed under authors' rights, in civil law (for instance the french "droit d'auteur"), where rights transfers seem to obey to slightly different rules.</p>

      <TITLE>Could the U.S. squeak out a compelling argument that it is not bound by the Equal Protection Clause or that it be treated differently than states?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Points of law</strong></p>
<p>“The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State from "deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Amdt. 14, § 1.” <em>Evenwel v. Abbott</em>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/evenwel-v-abbott-1?ssr=false&resultsNav=false&tab=keyword&jxs=adminmat,hi,9cirapp,dhi#p76" rel="nofollow noreferrer">578 U.S. 54, 76</a> (2016)</p>
<p>It does, indeed: "No State shall […] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." (U.S. Const. Amdt. 14, § 1.)</p>
<p><strong>Research and axiomatic foundations</strong></p>
<p>Many of the particular rules and federal decisional laws deriving from the Equal Protection Clause follow this principle; however, I have not been able to locate a formulation of it such that would declare it as a matter of law binding the federal government, and not just one state or another.</p>
<p>For this reason, I believed this might have been one of ""those settled usages and modes of proceeding" found in the common law[; (<em>Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272, 277 (1856)) … or ancient rules" (<em>Wooden v. United States</em> (<a href="https://casetext.com/case/wooden-v-united-states-9?p=1&q=Wooden%20v.%20United%20States_%20(Mar.%207,%202022,%20No.%2020-5279)&sort=relevance&type=case&ssr=false&scrollTo=true" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mar. 7, 2022, No. 20-5279</a>) [pp. 33-34]) conserved and provided under the Fifth Amendment in the meaning of the Due Process of Law.</p>
<p>For this reason, I looked at parallel legal systems into which the same ancient European ancestor divided into in hope to find an ancient latin sobriquet that would be used so and potentially carry similar meaning under U.S. jurisprudence.</p>
<p>The continental (and now British) jurisprudential principle of the "equality of arms" provides that the <em>integruos</em> or <em>decent</em> process of law requires that "the prosecution and the defence have equal opportunity and opportunity to express their views and positions on questions of fact and law in criminal proceedings [… under] Article 6(3) of the [European Convention of Human Rights ("ECHR")] […] and "ECtHR considers all non-criminal proceedings as civil proceedings for the purposes of Article 6, [(incl. of 'fair trial' in Article 6(1))] it should be borne in mind that the category established by the ECtHR includes administrative proceedings in addition to civil proceedings in the constitutional sense, where the requirement of equality of arms must also be satisfied." (Erzsébet A. Gácsi, <a href="https://ojs.mtak.hu/index.php/belugyiszemle/article/view/4715/3696" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The principle of equality of arms

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>I found no Latin cognate of the "equality of arms", and I failed to find it explicitly named under U.S. jurisprudence; hence, my own research ended there, and my question began here:</p>
<p>Can an argument be made that the federal government is not also bound by the same principle expressed here, in other words, can an argument be made that: The Federal government may deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p><strong>Accordingly, could an argument be made that the federal government is not subject to the provisions or any subsequent decisional-law formulation of the U.S. Constitution requiring that "all persons similarly circumstanced … be treated alike" (<em>Plyler v. Doe</em>, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/plyler-v-doe-texas-v-certain-named-and-unnamed-undocumented-alien-children?resultsNav=false&jxs=adminmat,hi,9cirapp,dhi&p=1&q=federal%20government%20to%20%22deny%20to%20any%20person%20within%20its%20jurisdiction%20the%20equal%20protection%20of%20the%20laws.%22&sort=relevance&type=case&ssr=false&scrollTo=true&find=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">457 U.S. 202, 216</a> (1982)) including by the United States?</strong></p>

      <TITLE>If one leaves the US to commit an act illegal in the US but legal in the country they travel to are they guilty of a crime?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Before anyone asks this is part legal curiosity, part proving for 'loopholes' that I could have villains in a story exploit, I don't need 100% accuracy so much as general guidelines, and any unique situation or known 'loophole' is also interesting.</p>

<p>I'm curious about how the US handles travel to other countries to activities crimes that are illegal within the US but legal in the country they travel to.  At first I thought that this would be legal, but I know sex tourism at the least is restricted, They actually make us take a training at work about how sex trafficking is bad in case we couldn't figure that one out on our own.  </p>

<p>A quick scan online tells me that the sex tourism thing is specific federal law.  Outside of sex tourism of individuals under the age of 18 are there other situations where one can be punished for traveling to another country to commit a crime?  If so are these specific laws that address only a few unique situations, or is there some general law that addresses many crimes committed by traveling to another country?</p>

<p>I can think of a number of theoretical odd situations as fodder for story telling, I'll likely ask a few of them in more detail in later questions depending on the answer in this one.  If someone wants to touch briefly on a few odd situations below in their answer I would be interested, but if any of these situations is too complex I'll ask them as a later follow up question.</p>

<ol>
<li>how does dual citizenship work in situations where it would be illegal for a US citizen to travel to country X to do activity Y, but the individual in question is not only a US citizen but also a citizen of X?</li>
<li>How much does 'premeditation' apply to these rules?  For instance my quick scanning of sex tourism law refers to an individual traveling to a country "with the intent to ...", does that mean if someone travels to a country and only then decides to do an activity it would be legal (ignoring the difficulty of proving it wasn't premeditated)?</li>
<li>Is a non-US citizen within the US (for instance with a visa, or even an illegal alien who lives in the US) still subject to these sort of laws if they leave the US with the intent of doing something illegal within the US and then return?</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit:  ...also Id love at least <em>one</em> other instance of an activity that would be a crime if someone travels elsewhere to do it.  I'm thinking of potential loophole abuse questions I could ask, but I <em>really</em> don't want to ask them in context of the sex tourism law.  Rather or not it's just a theoretical question to explore legal oddities I really don't like even hypothesizing the sort of situation that leads to someone trying to violate that particular law.</p>

<p>If the officer in question discloses the bribe, pays tax on it etc, and continues to do the action they intended despite the bribe, are they legally allowed to accept it?</p>

<p>In this case assume a situation with a simple binary option of doing either X or Y so that it's obvious that the officer either was or was not influenced by the bribe, with no ambiguous middle ground.

      <TITLE>Is it legal to let sister-in-law drive my vehicle in another state and have her on my insurance?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This is about my wife's sister who is a single parent mom and lives in a different state. Not sure if it matters but I live in Massachusetts and she lives in Georgia.</p>

<p>Because of her life situation she has not been able to afford car payments and I for this reason have allowed her to use one of the two cars that are in my name. In this case this means I make the monthly payments on these cars and I also pay for the car insurance for both of them.</p>

<p>Both of my cars are insured from the same company. On the insurance, she is listed as a driver for the car that she has with her in Georgia, and that car is also listed as garaged in Georgia.</p>

<p>Can the car insurance company legally deny insuring the vehicle she is driving in this kind of case?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The reason for my question is that the car was in an accident where parts of the body (side front bumper, and side rear panel) got scratched. This happened when the car was parked outside a shopping center (someone tried to squeeze into a parking space next to it), meaning that she was not driving the car, or even inside it, at the time. A police report was made about this incident but it is not yet known if the driver of that other car had insurance, as they had left the scene after bumping into this car (some passerby got the tag# of that other car and gave it to my sister-in-law).</p>

<p>When we asked the insurance company about this, we eventually received the reply that the insurance company "is not going to insure the [car] that is garaged in Georgia,  they are going to issue legal notice to cancel the insurance since [my sister-in-law's] residence is there."</p>

<p>The insurance policy has listed her as the driver on the car garaged in Georgia for 3 years. So if there was an issue with this setup, I would have thought that we had been informed about it.</p>

<p>I am not particularly concerned about whether they are willing to cover the damage, as it is not major and the insurance in any case has a $500 deductible. The concern and question I have is about the "legal notice" from the insurance company, because that implies that this setup has been somehow illegal.</p>

      <TITLE>How does the GDPR apply to software developed by one company and used by another?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I work for a bespoke software development company and I've been doing a lot of reading about the GDPR before it comes into force next year.</p>

<p>A lot of it makes sense, however I'm really struggling to find out what effect this has on us - specifically the impact when we write software that another company uses to process their customers' data. Are we a data controller, processor or neither in this case?</p>

<p>If we had direct access to customer data for testing the software I'm pretty sure we'd be a data processor, but does this still apply if we don't have access to (nor host) the data?</p>

<p>Could some kind soul please help me understand?</p>

<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>

<p>For reference here are the main sources I've consulted (plus lots of fruitless searching...):</p>

<p>How am I, as the average user, to decide if I'm agreeing or not to the choice with "Out" or "In"?</p>
<p>Both buttons are the same color of blue when pressed, so there is absolutely 0 clear indicator on what I am exactly choosing. I don't know if this is a mistake or just pure malice to trick users into accidentally agreeing with all cookies, but it really annoyed me, and I want to know if the law actually says whether the consent has to be named clearly (as in, "I agree" vs "I disagree" etc.) - otherwise I can see this is a big loophole that people can abuse.</p>
<p>Also funny: You cannot open the "Privacy Statement" link on the bottom, because when trying to read that you are blocked by the cookie popup again.</p>

      <BODY><p>14th amendment states "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, <strong>and subject to the jurisdiction thereof</strong>, are citizens of the United States...".</p>

<p>Given this wording how is it that foreign diplomats' children born in United States do not have birthright to US citizenship because they are not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" and children of tourists and illegal immigrants do have the birthright to US citizenship? </p>

<p>In other words, how is it that these two categories are "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" and therefore their children have the right to US citizenship by birth?</p>

<p>Edit:
As mentioned below, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark" rel="noreferrer">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</a>, Ark was granted citizenship by birth although his parents were foreign nationals and this is cited by many as a precedent for birthright citizenship for tourists and illegal immigrants. However, according to the same article, Ark's parents "were legally domiciled and resident" in United States at the time of his birth and tourists and illegal immigrants are not so can this decision really be used as legal precedent for birthright citizenship for tourists and illegal immigrants?</p>

      <TITLE>Employer-mandated participation in self-help meetings with strong pseudo-science and religious undertones</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>My employer has started a 7-week series of classes, to which all employees currently on the clock are expected to attend. We are paid for the time the same as if we had been working. The self-help classes are by a "Foot Zone" therapist, and so far have involved both pseudo-science and religious undertones and terminology specific to the LDS ("Mormon") faith. The subject matter falls far, far outside the scope of work at our small software company. (Here's an article about the speaker, <a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/south/elk-ridge/foot-zone-therapy-a-natural-way-to-heal-users-say/article_df09d5f3-86ef-573e-b04e-cdad3da0a0b6.html" rel="nofollow">Julie Cheney</a>)</p>

<p>Both the CEO and our one HR employee (small company, about 40 employees) are fully in support of these classes. These two people backing these classes means that even if it's not technically mandatory, there's certainly pressure for employees to attend or to at least not complain openly about it.</p>

<p>Everyone in attendance was under the impression that it was mandatory, though at the end there was an unclear comment by the CEO indicating that it <em>might not</em> be truly mandatory.</p>

<p>I plan to have a 1-on-1 talk with my manager to bring up the problems I have with this series of courses. I expect he will then bring it up with upper management and/or HR. I have plenty of good points and I already know that this manager disliked the class fairly strongly.</p>

<p>In the US, and in Utah, are there any laws prohibiting or proscribing this sort of thing by an employer? Does it matter if they are mandatory, as opposed to strongly encouraged but technically not mandatory?</p>

<p>UPDATE:
As of Friday, Jan 8th, it's officially mandatory. Good grief.</p>

<p>It is now outside of the 1-year warranty offered by the manufacturer, but is well within the time frame for <em>warranties against defects</em> guidelines of the EU overall as well as of the specific EU country.

      <TITLE>Why don't lawyers keep a queue of contingency cases?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I frequently encounter situations in which there is likely civil liability between two parties but where the aggrieved party does not pursue legal action because they lack money and/or expertise.</p>

<p>Occasionally I have approached lawyers when I see such cases with apparently positive (risk-adjusted) expected return from at least threatening, if not actually carrying out, litigation.  And I usually get one of two answers:</p>

<ol>
<li>We're too busy to do something like that on contingency right now.</li>
<li>We don't think the odds of prevailing and collecting merit the cost of pursuing that on contingency.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, but I follow the industry well enough to know that there are a lot of lawyers lacking for work.  If you're an unemployed lawyer, or a solo practitioner without a full caseload, then isn't <em>any</em> non-frivolous case with a positive potential payout worth pursuing?  And if you're a firm with the sunk cost of offices, staff, subscriptions, etc., wouldn't you always want those assets working at 100% capacity?</p>

<p>Therefore, why doesn't every practice <em>want</em> a queue of potentially profitable contingency cases that they can chip away at when they don't have a 100% paid workload?  I can understand that if one took a contingency case into litigation, and then paid work came along, one wouldn't want the contingency case distracting from the paid work.  But can't one accept a case on contingency <em>and</em> "as time permits," so that in such an event one would simply drop the contingency case (or, if it looked promising, hand it off to some other lawyer in a slump)?</p>

<p>Are there practical or professional reasons this is not standard practice?</p>

<p>From an economic perspective this seems odd: As a client if I don't have the means to pursue a legitimate claim, then (on principle) I might be willing to give up to 100% of any winnings to a lawyer who does pursue it.  As a lawyer, if I have a positive expected return to a contingency case, I'd like to have the option of picking that up when I can't find other work (to within some error term – perhaps the alternative of running a coffee shop out of my office, or taking a minimum-wage writing job.)</p>

If this is true, how would that work for an item like keys, whose extrinsic value I'd assume is somehow related to what it unlocks? If a person stole:</p>
<ol>
<li>keys to an empty house</li>
<li>keys to a safe containing 1MM USD</li>
<li>keys to a new car</li>
<li>keys to a recognized sensitive area (police evidence locker)</li>

      <TITLE>Can a US President give police a "kill order"?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Warning: spoilers for the TV show <em>Designated Survivor</em> ahead.</strong></p>

<p>The American TV drama <em>Designated Survivor</em> is set in a hypothetical world where terrorists have successfully attacked the State of the Union address and killed nearly all of the senior members of the US government. Many early episodes have plot points centering around Constitutional issues and Presidential powers that Americans will remember from their school days (e.g. the ability of the President to federalize units of the National Guard). Based on those early episodes, it's clear the show is <em>attempting</em> to be accurate in its depiction of existing US law, and not just making stuff up wildly or in an alternate reality with different laws.</p>

<p>In S1E11 of the show, police officers have surrounded a building where they believe a terrorist is hiding. They are on US soil, and believe that the occupant of the building is the person who attempted to assassinate the president several hours earlier. It is unclear if they know the nationality/citizenship status of the terrorist.</p>

<p>The (Acting) President of the United States has an open line of communication to the on-scene police commander from a bunker in the White House. Other characters explain that standard procedure is for police to attempt to take the alleged terrorist into custody so that criminal charges may be brought, and for police to not fire their weapons unless attacked. The President gives a preemptive order for police to kill the suspect even if a non-lethal option is available. His advisors object, but he overrules them, explicitly commanding them to "shoot to kill."</p>

<p>The show set things up to feel sort of like a Commander-in-Chief giving orders to a military unit in a war zone overseas, but ultimately, the scenario was a domestic police operation. So, is this something a President can actually do, from a legal standpoint? Or did the show decide to ignore reality in the service of the plot this time?</p>

To elaborate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm from Germany, the other developer is from Turkey</p></li>
<li><p>The app is distributed using the Google Play store (US-based)</p></li>

<li><p>My app was created from the ground up and doesn't use any sources of other apps (I created the layout by myself as well)</p></li>
<li><p>The other developer seems to hold at least some sort of copyright in Turkey: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/HWtyDh4" rel="noreferrer">https://imgur.com/a/HWtyDh4</a> (blacked out)</p></li>
<li><p>Both have a very, very similar name. There are 40+ apps on Android alone which share this name as well. There was software prior to both apps with this name.</p></li>

<p>Ann belongs to a denomination that accepts the existence of transgender people as what they claim they are. Ann starts a company that grows to over 25 employees, at which point the company must follow EEOC regulations, which include nondiscrimination on the basis of religion.</p>

<p>Then let's say a different Christian, Christine, applies for a job at Ann's company. Christine previously worked for a Christian organization that belongs to a denomination which believes that transgenderism is against God. When Ann sees this past experience on Christine's resume, she immediately excludes Christine from consideration for employment.</p>

<p>If Christine wanted to sue Ann's company, would she have a case? Let's assume that Ann gave written evidence to Christine that she was excluded because of her past religious work - clearly, few employers would be stupid enough to do this, but let's grant that assumption for the purposes of this question.</p>

<p>How would the law settle a dispute like this - one that is between two Christians with divergent beliefs.</p>

      <TITLE>Can messages in messaging application be used as evidence to accuse someone?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>For domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, abusive partners can misuse messaging to harass, intimidate, and threaten.</p>
<p>How significant is evidence of messages in a messaging application (like WhatsApp) considered in this case, assuming there is little to no other circumstantial evidence?</p>
<p>I am a computer science researcher and studying the deniability property of messaging applications. The deniability property of messaging ensures that if Alice and Bob communicate over messaging applications, neither of them can prove cryptographically to a third-party who sent which message. Both parties can forge each other's messages without leaving any trace.
For my research, I am trying to understand if the messaging applications are being used as evidence and to what extent. Could it be possible to put a false accusation on someone just based on the messaging application? And how do cyber law specific to this differ from state to state? Any pointers to other resources would be helpful too.</p>

      <TITLE>When translating the law, who ensures that the wording does not change the meaning of the law?</TITLE>
      <BODY><h1>Background</h1>
<p>The United States has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_United_States" rel="noreferrer">no official language</a> and has Federal Law based off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States#Federal_law" rel="noreferrer">Constitution</a> and derived from the English System.  Most of the Law in the United States is written in English, since most people in the United States speak English. However, there are bound to be people that do not speak English and need to understand how the law applied to them.  Thus, the law needs to be translated into different languages now and again for situations such as someone who does not understand English.</p>
<p>However, in the process of translation, small things like punctuation and order of clauses can drastically change how the force of law operates.  For example, he part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that got struck down was influenced by a specific interpretation of an <a href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2205&context=dlj" rel="noreferrer">ambiguous semicolon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court shall have [original] jurisdiction over all cases of a civil nature where a state is a party, ... And shall have exclusively all such jurisdiction of suits or proceedings against ambassadors, or other public ministers, .... And the trial of issues in fact ... shall be by jury. The Supreme Court shall also have appellate jurisdiction from the circuit courts and courts of the several states, in the cases herein after specially provided for; and shall have power to issue ... writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed, or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States.</p>
<p>— Judiciary Act of 1789, Section 13</p>

<p>often it is to conform to federal guidelines - so they are directed to higher the CEO’s nephew, but they get government contracts so they HAVE to follow the proper forms and pretend to interview for the position, wasting managers, HR and candidates time.</p>

<p><a href="https://workplace.stackexchange.com/a/177651/64946">This workplace stack exchange answer</a> contains the claim that sometimes employers interview candidates they don’t want to hire because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have an H-1B candidate already lined up and ready to go, and they don't actually want to give the job to anyone else, but are legally required to pretend to look for people. Legally, they're supposed to prefer to hire an American worker if possible, but in practice, the law is very difficult to enforce because the company can always come up with some excuse for why candidate X wasn't good enough.

      <TITLE>Adaptations of partially expired copyright in some countries</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Let's say that there are 2 (hypothetical) countries with different copyright durations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Country A has a copyright duration of Life + 70 years.</li>
<li>Country B has a copyright duration of Life + 50 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Country A does not apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_the_shorter_term" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rule of the shorter term</a>.</p>
<p>A work was published in Country B by an author who died 65 years ago. Let's call this the "original work." An adaptation (known as "derivative work" in the United States) of the original work was later published in Country B since the work is in the public domain. The author of this adaptation chose to license their work with a public-domain equivalent license (perhaps <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CC0</a>).</p>
<p>My understanding of copyright is that it grants the author an exclusive right to distribute their work in whatever manner they'd like for some amount of time (determined by the copyright duration in a country).</p>
<p>Can a person in Country A legally use the adapted work? I'm assuming no, but then does that mean that the author of the work created in Country B does not technically have all the rights to the work they created, since they have no control over whether their work can be distributed in Country A? If that is the case, then would these rights be "granted" to the author of the adaptation when the copyright finally expires in Country A?</p>

Am I misunderstanding something about international copyright law as enacted by treaties such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Berne</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Copyright_Convention" rel="nofollow noreferrer">UCC</a>?</p>

<p>I can see where they're coming from: various descriptions of price fixing I can find on google seem to use broad strokes, suggesting any coordination intended to affect market value of a service amounts to the crime. But then I also see professionals talking about it on bigger social media platforms like Twitter, encouraging their peers to price themselves higher (apparently it's common for newer software contractors in particular to undervalue their services and underestimate their costs).

The software also has some prefectly legitimate uses in IT administration, for example penetration testing. The company has some legitimate customers using it that way. Now suppose the police manage to prove that a crimimal rented/ bought the software and then used it for a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Did the company break any laws?</p>
<p>I feel this is somewhat similar to manufacturing guns but this would require some government agency to declare the software as a weapon and impose restriction on the sale and use of it.

<p>I've noticed that a lot of projects (even some commercial products) use the "JAMMA" term without any obvious endorsement by the trade association (e.g. <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/jamma-rgb-pi-board.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.retrorgb.com/jamma-rgb-pi-board.html</a>).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From this passage, I understand that only Congress has the power to create and regulate currency (a means of payment and a store of value) in the United States. Congress may also delegate some or all parts of this power, which they have done in favor of the Federal Reserve. By that understanding, any instrument used as a means of payment and a store of value not produced by Congress or under Congressional mandate violates Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. A recent example of such a violation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_dollar_(private_currency)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Liberty Dollar</a>, a privately minted coinage distributed and redeemable within the United States and backed by precious metals.</p>

      <TITLE>Conflicting terms and the definition of a «child»</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This is similar to <a href="/questions/2263/what-happens-if-two-clauses-in-a-contract-come-into-conflict">this question</a> but applies to a specific scenario.</p>

<p>In the Norwegian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotment_(gardening)#Norway" rel="nofollow noreferrer">allotment garden community</a> I belong to, a young child recently lost her mother to cancer. The statutes say that a <em>“spouse, <strong>child</strong> or grandchild”</em> can inherit the parcel, but also that a member of the community must have reached age of majority. To a layman such as myself, this may be interpreted as a potential conflict, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child#Biological,_legal_and_social_definitions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">quoting Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Legally, the term <strong>child</strong> may refer to anyone below the age of majority or some other age limit. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines child as "a human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paragraph saying that the <em>“spouse, child or grandchild”</em> can inherit was modified most recently. Previously, it said <em>“spouse, child, grandchild <strong>or parent</strong>”</em>. Thus, when a minor lost her parent, a grandparent could assume ownership until the child reached age of majority. However, parents were barred from inheriting because this facilitated transition between adult siblings, which was seen as undesirable.</p>

<p>I assume the child must move if either of the following are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>«child»</em> can, in legal terms, refer to an <em>adult</em> son or daughter.</li>
<li>The <em>most recent change</em> in the statutes has precedence.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the Convention on the Rights of the Child <a href="https://www.unicef.org/crc/files/Guiding_Principles.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">state</a> that <em>“The best interests of children must be the primary concern in making decisions that may affect them (…)”</em>, so again to a layman, that could indicate that if there are indeed conflicting terms, the favour should go in to the child.</p>

<p>The board of the allotment garden community has decided that the child must sell her parcel. Given the wording in the statutes, especially the legal definition of a «child», and the order in which the paragraphs were written, is the case clearly in favour of a forced sale?</p>

<p>The issue I'm trying to resolve is that a tenant is in breach of an agreement because of how and where they are dumping inorganic waste. I simply want it removed, although doing this will be a big job for the tenant - I'm quite happy for the tenant to use my tractor to help move the waste and to arrange extra empties of my tip for him, but don't want this to be construed as changing our agreement or binding me to continue to allow him to use my tip in the future.</p>

<p>I understand there probably will (and probably should) be some leeway in this, but if one was arrested for breach of the peace, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_the_police_in_England_and_Wales#Breach_of_the_peace" rel="nofollow noreferrer">under English common law does not require an arrest warrant</a>, could that then be dropped and replaced with another charge that would've required an arrest warrant?</p>
<p>Or, if there is some leeway to do this, can it be challenged? It seems to be, shall we say, <em>convenient</em> that the police are using a power that is given for situations of immediate need in a way that could be said to circumvent the system somewhat.</p>
<p>I've had another look through the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE)</a> and through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/police-and-criminal-evidence-act-1984-pace-codes-of-practice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">codes of practice for PACE</a> but haven't found anything referring to this.</p>

      <TITLE>Left item in an Airbnb, host no longer available. Responsibility lies with owner, host or Airbnb?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>After staying one night in an Airbnb, my friend realised he left an item in the property (not expensive, cost of around €50).</p>
<p>I immediately contacted the Host over Airbnb messaging, she confirmed she had found the item and would post it out to me (I asked how much postage would cost and how to pay her). This was the last time I would hear back from the host.</p>
<p>Giving time for the busy postage period over Christmas, I tried to contact the host again around 20 days later but didn't get a reply. After another week, I contacted Airbnb support who said that the host had already responded that she would send the item out in the post.</p>
<p>After yet another couple of weeks waiting, I reached out to Airbnb again. This time, I spoke to someone who said they would try to reach out to the host. A couple of days had passed and they got back to me and said they were unable to reach the host and there was nothing they could do and that would be the end of it. Furthermore, they said I couldn't apply for a refund through their <a href="https://www.airbnb.ie/help/article/767/how-the-resolution-center-helps-you?locale=en&_set_bev_on_new_domain=1643189564_YzI3MzEzNWMyOWQ2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">resolution centre</a> as 60 days had passed since the trip.</p>
<p>I'm wondering from a legal perspective where responsibility lies (mostly as a thought exercise). My friend should have taken his property with him, but presumably the host can't just keep it, especially after reaching out to them?</p>
<p>As my contract was with Airbnb and the host works from them, <strong>is there any responsibility on their part</strong>, e.g. Could I hypothetically open a small claims case against them? Or would any small claims case <strong>be directly against the host</strong> themselves?</p>

      <BODY><p>Many legal documents follow along the same lines as this one, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, in whatever medium provided, whether unmodified or modified by Receiving Party or its Representatives (as defined herein), whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to: (i) any marketing strategies, plans, financial information, or projections, operations, sales estimates, business plans and performance results relating to the past, present or future business activities of such party, its affiliates, subsidiaries and affiliated companies; (ii) plans for products or services, and customer or supplier lists; (iii) any scientific or technical information, invention, design, process, procedure, formula, improvement, technology or method; (iv) any concepts, reports, data, know-how, works-in-progress, designs, development tools, specifications, computer software, source code, object code, flow charts, databases, inventions, information and trade secrets; (v) any other information that should reasonably be recognized as confidential information of the Disclosing Party; and (vi) any information generated by the Receiving Party or by its Representatives that contains, reflects, or is derived from any of the foregoing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phew! That is one long sentence. The key thing is "<strong>including, but not limited to</strong>". If you are really saying "everything you can possibly imagine", or "the unlimited possibilities of potential things", I don't see why you can't just leave it at that, and leave out all the permutations/examples like "tangible and intangible", etc.. It could be simply shortened to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all possible information shared by the Disclosing Party.</p>

However, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-25" rel="nofollow noreferrer">18 USC Ch 25</a> clearly applies only when the intended victim or misrepresented party is the United States/agents/etc itself.</p>
<p>Since attempted fraud is basically a predicate offense of forgery, presumably the latter is more serious. Given that federal statute treats "interstate commerce" very liberally (the reach of mail and wire fraud is extremely broad), why didn't congress create a separate crime for interstate forgery? (Start with a copy of 18 USC Ch 25 with all references to "the United States/etc" replaced with "any person, across state lines" and adjust from there.)</p>

      <TITLE>What authority (or authorities) have established the status of State ratifications of U.S. Constitutional amendments?</TITLE>
      <BODY><h1>Background</h1>
<p>In the United States, the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NARA</a> is the authority that receives all final documents related to the State ratification of a United States Constitutional amendment as implied <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/united-states-code.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">on the NARA website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TITLE 1 -- GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER 2 -- ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS; FORMALITIES OF ENACTMENT; REPEALS;
SEALING OF INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Sec. 106b. Amendments to Constitution</p>
<p>Whenever official notice is received at the National Archives and
Records Administration that any amendment proposed to the Constitution
of the United States has been adopted, according to the provisions of
the Constitution, the Archivist of the United States shall forthwith
cause the amendment to be published, with his certificate, specifying
the States by which the same may have been adopted, and that the same
has become valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the
Constitution of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the NARA has also received recession or rejections of certain Constitutional amendments from the states, the validity of which is not pronounced by the head archivist, but is seen as conclusive by another (unnamed) authority as stated <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a few instances, States have sent official documents to NARA to record the rejection of an amendment or the rescission of a prior ratification. The Archivist does not make any substantive determinations as to the validity of State ratification actions, but it has been established that the Archivist's certification of the facial legal sufficiency of ratification documents is final and conclusive.</p>

<p>Since the most credible source I found on the matter does not state who "established" that the legal sufficiency of ratification documents is final and conclusive, I wanted to ask the following question:</p>

      <TITLE>Can a person be fired for not agreeing to a contract at work?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I have seen contracts (relating to employment) which contain terms like "by accepting this position you agree to sign an NDA that you will be provided on your first day of work". To my understanding these are unenforceable. </p>

<p>Can a person be fired for refusing to agree to a contract? Assuming my above understanding is correct, does it make a difference if they had at any point agreed to agree to a contract? Often times when a person is hired there is an on boarding process which contains a bunch of paperwork. Hypothetically could a person refuse to sign it and not get penalized? </p>

<p>There can be many (legitimate and illegitimate) reasons why someone must sign something relating to their employment. For example I was given the added responsibility to do work on the servers which were located in a rented secure building. This building had their own paperwork I needed to fill out for clearance purposes (like a background check). If I refused to do this could I have been fired? </p>

      <TITLE>Is it legal to make a counteroffer without mentioning that the contract was altered?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This question is very similar to <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26701/do-i-have-to-notify-the-other-party-of-changes-i-made-to-the-contract-before-sig">this one</a>. It's about a hypothetical scenario in which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Party A (an individual or a company) writes a contract and sends it to party B</li>
<li>Party B makes small changes to the contract, and signs it</li>
<li>Party A signs the contract, but is unaware of the changes</li>
</ul>

<p>The only answer to the question linked above states something along the lines of "it's a grey zone, theoretically it's legal, but don't try it" which of course is the reasonable answer to this type of scenario. But the following questions remain unanswered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does B have a legal obligation to inform A that changes were made to the document?</li>
<li>Is there any legal basis for A to argue that the procedure was dishonest, because they were expecting to sign "X" but they ended up signing "Y"?</li>
</ul>

<p>Intuitively I would imagine that "I didn't read the document" is not a justification for A to contest the terms of the contract. </p>

<p>However, imagine the case of, say, loan contracts: considering 1) the length and complexity of the documents 2) the number of hours it would take for bank employees to read the thousands of contracts signed every year and 3) the significant financial incentive to be dishonest by changing e.g. the interest rate in the document, I would be surprised that nobody tried to kind of trick.</p>

<p>This question is not specific to the example of bank contract, or to a country in particular - though I'm mostly interested in Europe/North America. I'm just curious to understand what legally prevents this type of things from happening in general.</p>

      <TITLE>Is this (hypothetical situation) rape and/or rape by deception?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>In this (completely hypothetical) situation where identical twins are impossible to tell apart, would/could a prosecutor bring charges of rape?</p>

<p>This takes place in England. Apologies for length.</p>

<p>To make the situation as clear as possible, I've called the twins Draco and Harry.</p>

<p>Draco meets Ginny and goes out on several dates but she won’t have sex with him because she’s not sure about him. He breaks a date (to screw another woman instead) and sends his identical twin, Harry, in his place. Ginny has such a good time with Harry that she tries to convince him to come back to her place for sex. Harry refuses because he's a good guy and she’s Draco’s girl.</p>

<p>On a future date, Ginny has consensual sex with Draco (because the dates with Harry were so wonderful). But Harry continues to step in whenever Draco breaks a date, because he’s desperate to spend time with Ginny and has fallen in love with her. Eventually, Harry can’t help himself, he has sex with Ginny.</p>

<p>The twins continue to share Ginny over a period of a year without her knowing they are two different men. Harry proposes and convinces Draco that he should attend the ceremony. Draco agrees because he’s really just using Ginny for sex anyway.</p>

<p>After three years of marriage, Draco thinks Ginny is getting suspicious, and coming between him and Harry. Draco resolves that Ginny has to go. Draco tries to shoot Ginny, but Harry steps in at the last minute and shoots Draco in the head, saving Ginny’s life (and the life of her unborn child, and a police officer Draco has left for dead in the bathtub upstairs).</p>

<p>Harry confesses their entire scam to the police. He only continued the scam because he was in love with Draco’s girl, and didn’t tell Ginny the truth because he was terrified of losing her. </p>

<p><strong>He didn't create the deception specifically to gain consent.</strong></p>

<p>Even though Ginny wants nothing to do with Harry anymore, she won’t bring charges of rape. Harry's still her husband and the sex was always consensual. Also, she can’t help herself, she still loves him.</p>

<p>What arguments could a prosecutor bring forward to accuse Harry of rape?</p>

<p>And what arguments against could a defence counsel present to prevent Harry being charged?</p>

<hr>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>I've already done a lot of research on this. I'm aware of the law (in as much as a person with no legal experience can be).</p>

<p>But: </p>

<p>I've spoken to a Metropolitan Police Officer who said that, while consent by deception is rape, the prosecutor would have a flimsy case in these circumstances. </p>

<p>And I spoke to a lawyer who said, consent by deception is rape, there is no getting around it. Even without Ginny, the prosecutor would bring charges of rape. Whether a jury would deliver a guilty verdict is another matter.</p>

<p>Under s76 of the Sexual Offences Act 2006, it is possible to commit rape by gaining consent through deception. </p>

<p>The Riddle of Rape-by-Deception and the Myth of Sexual Autonomy says that "rape by deception is almost universally rejected in American criminal law." But this is England.</p>

<p>And Mr Justice Stephens said, "the only sorts of fraud which so far destroy the effect of a woman's consent as to convert a connection consented to in fact into a rape are frauds as to the nature of the act itself, or as to the identity of the person who does the act. Consent in such cases does not exist at all because the act consented to is not the act done." And the identity of who Ginny gave consent to is in question.</p>

<p>@ohwilleke posted a comment on a similar question saying, "Consent obtained by deception is consent in every jurisdiction I have examined"</p>

<hr>

<p>With conflicting advice, I'd be interested to know what arguments you might bring forward depending on whether you were prosecuting or defending Harry.</p>

<p>I am a software developer and I am more comfortable reading legal documents in English than in my native language. The other reasons why I chose the UK are</p>

<ul>
<li>I have good experience with an unnamed mail forwarding/scanning service that offers a 'registered office address'.</li>
<li>It consistently ranks among the top 10 in the 'Ease of doing business' index</li>

<li>The Companies House needs to be informed about the location of the company records unless they are at the registered address. They may object to them being located outside the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>The mail forwarding service and all its competitors cease their operations. I suppose it would be possible to wind up the company even without a registered office address. I can travel to the UK if necessary.</li>

      <TITLE>Is the embargo against Cuba unconstitutional?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>The Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC that government restrictions on spending for political purposes are prohibited by the First Amendment. Would that make the economic embargo against Cuba unconstitutional?</p>
<p>Related questions might be: Does "money is speech" apply to all kinds of spending? Does the spending have to be political in motivation? Maybe I am missing an important distinction, but I thought the point of the ruling was that it is not up to the government to decide which kind of speech is permissible.</p>
<p>I am not asking if all embargoes are unconstitutional. An embargo against a country with whom we are at war seems to me to be a difference in kind. We are not at war with Cuba, North Korea, or Iran. Nevertheless, my understanding is that right now, it is a federal crime for me to travel to Cuba and buy a cigar. This seems inconsistent with how most Americans think of freedom.</p>
<p>I went on a cruise from Port Canaveral to Havana in 2018. I was constantly reminded that, as a U.S. citizen, I was prohibited from spending money in other than well-defined ways. Passengers from other countries (e.g., Canada) were free to do whatever they wanted. I saw many advertisements for investments directed at those with such freedom.</p>
<p>I was presented with many opportunities to buy items with imagery of Che Guevara. Assuming the prohibitions are constitutional as long as my spending is politically motivated, would buying such souvenirs have been permissible?</p>
<p>There were frequent announcements and documents supplied which informed and reminded us that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Treasury limited our interactions.

      <TITLE>How can it be legal to buy and sell zero-day exploits in the US?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>There are companies like Zerodium (Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerodium" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerodium</a>) that buy "functional exploits" and sell them to "corporate and government clients". These are zero-day vulnerabilities, that is, vulnerabilities that are unknown to the developer of the software. Ethical hackers and professional security researchers typically report these vulnerabilities to the developer, so that they can be fixed. But companies like Zerodium buy these exploits and resell them to somebody else, we don't know who exactly. These people who buy the exploits from Zerodium are not going to use them legally, because as far as I know there is no reasonable way to use a zero-day exploit legally, other than reporting it to the developer (which they are not doing). Apparently the government is also buying the exploits from them, but that doesn't make it legal anyway.</p>

<p>Somebody might think that this is more or less like buying and selling guns, which is legal in the US. However, it's not really like that. First of all, guns can be used for several legitimate purposes, from fun to self-defense, while zero-days exploits cannot reasonably have such purposes IMO. And then, we don't really know who companies like Zerodium are selling the exploits to.</p>

<p>So how can all this be legal? Are there any specific laws in this field that allow it? Or are there any laws that would define this as illegal, or allow somebody to sue such companies in any way?</p>

      <TITLE>Online Service Requires 2-User Minimum Billing for Per-User Priced Product</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Is this legal under Payment for Services Not Rendered if only one user account is ever used?</p>
<p>I'm using an online service, <a href="https://hubstaff.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hubstaff</a>, to keep track of my time and invoice clients for the time I work on their projects. This service has flexible per-user billing plans. However, they require you sign up for a minimum of two users, even if you will only ever use one user account.</p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://support.hubstaff.com/per-user-pricing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Explanation of their Per-User Pricing</a> and details about their <a href="https://hubstaff.com/pricing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Available Plans</a>.</p>
<p>They have a free plan, but it doesn't have the features I need. They have three additional paid plans starting at $7/month/user plan, but, like I said, you have to pay for two users so it costs a minimum of $14/month even though you may only ever use one account.</p>
<p>The reason this bothers me is I was using their service since 2018 and it was $5/user and I was accurately billed $5/month because I only had one user account with them. Since around February of 2020 they made this change and my bill went to $14/month but they also screwed up their billing changes and I got some additional $7 charges and $14 charges for some reason.</p>
<p>I feel like it's legal, but just extremely slimy. Like some business executive said they want to make more money per user and their solution was to say the service still only costs $7/user but you MUST pay for a minimum two-user plan. I can almost guarantee the vast majority of the users of their software are single user accounts.</p>
<p>There's absolutely no technical reason they require customers to have a two-user plan.</p>

      <TITLE>How to pressure college covering-up incompetent professor?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I received a grade I deem unsatisfactory for the quality of work I completed, due to lateness penalties. The course instructor was partly responsible; he has <em>never responded to several of my assignment inquiries</em>. His non-response added several extra hours to my work, prompting lateness on said assignments - enough to lower the letter grade.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the professor has given <em>zero</em> feedback on any of my essay or research project submissions in this course of 'Engineering Ethics', only grades - and has remained 2-3 weeks avg. behind on grading.</p>

<p>I filed a complaint along a grade appeal to the Department Chair, describing said concerns, and proposing a resolution in form of raising the letter-grade (from which I am 0.2% away) - after failing to find a resolution with the professor. The chair denied the appeal. I forwarded the matter to the Dean of Students, who referred to the Vice Provost.</p>

<p>The response from all of them, in a nutshell, was "Policy was followed." None of them made <em>any</em> response to the complaint - which was detailed, and comprised majority of my letters. This was hardly a surprise*.</p>

<p>This said, there's zero intent on behalf of the administration to bulge on this matter. The only college official I'm yet to contact is the Provost - who I doubt will respond any different unless I shift gears.</p>

<hr>

<p>That policy was followed in grading is true, but overlooks the fact that my grade suffered directly from the professor's negligence - unsure how to press on this point further (or pursue others). <br> Short of a lawsuit, what approach is advisable to increase the odds of winning the grade raise? 
<hr>
<strong><em>Additional info:</em></strong> It's a state university. Professor is a "Faculty Lecturer", untenured.</p>

<p>'* - the institution is ridden with incompetence: professors often lack basic understanding of course material, lab manuals are filled with faulty and ill-grammared instructions, outdated website, and a 'sheep'-like student culture that takes any sh*t from professors (hence the lack of accountability).</p>

<p>Worth noting, I called out the chair directly in my letter to the Dean, accusing "complicity with academic negligence" - and stated, "unless [college] is willing to risk being exposed as a scam institution, it should focus less on doing cover-ups and instead address the problem."</p>

      <TITLE>In the English law, how is a conflict of interest between an extradition request and a criminal conviction solved?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This question was motivated by Julian Assange's famous case, but it is a more general question.</p>

<p>As it is <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/julian-assange-prison-jail-time-weeks-bail-embassy-a8894326.html?amp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">known</a>, he currently has a conviction of 50 weeks prison term for bail jumping. Thus, England wants him to serve it in a prison (jail?).</p>

<p>From the other side, another country - this time, the USA - wants him, without a conviction (in the USA), but because also they want to punish him.</p>

<p>Thus, we have a conflict of interest:</p>

<ol>
<li>The English criminal system wants him to serve his punishment. They are probably tuned to not allow him to go to anywhere, until he served his prison term.</li>
<li>Also the criminal system of another country wants him. The U.K. is bound by international agreements to give him to them.</li>
</ol>

<p>The logical solution would be to first make him to serve his punishment in the U.K., and then extradict him to the USA. It seems a likely outcome in JA's case, but not always.</p>

<p>For example, in the case of a famous terrorist or war criminal, it would be surreal to delay his criminal procedure, only because he committed also some traffic offense in the U.K.</p>

<p>Which interest will be stronger? How is it being decided?</p>

<p>In this case this question is specifically related to writing "news" articles about news that are covered at other news sites.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this thing of copying the gist of a news item, or paraphrasing a
news article that has appeared at some other site, copyright
infringement?</li>
<li>Or is it covered by the fair-use laws that exist in USA?</li>
<li>If it is not covered by fair-use laws, how do so many different news
sites get around writing about the same subject without infringing
on a copyright? Are there some informal agreements or formal
contracts that cover for this?</li>

      <TITLE>How many people must be on the board of directors of a U.S. nonprofit organization?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Non-legally-savvy individual in Pennsylvania (PA) in the U.S. here. I've been learning a little about nonprofit corporations recently, and have had trouble finding a definitive answer to the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many people must be on the board of directors of a U.S. nonprofit organization?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand this is ill-defined and state dependent; to be more precise, I'm most interested in finding out:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the minimum number of distinct people that are required to be on the board of directors at the time of filing of incorporation documents for a PA nonprofit corporation?</li>
<li>What is the minimum number of distinct people that are required to be on the board of directors by the IRS at the time of a nonprofit corps. 501(c)(3) application (in order to possibly be granted status)?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm mainly interested in the minimum number of <em>people</em>, so if e.g. three "titles" or "positions" are required on the board in PA, but they can all be filled by one person, I am trying to ask the question whose answer would be 1 in that case.</p>
<p>I'm interested in the answers to these questions, but only insofar as those answers can be justified by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official documentation or guidance from the IRS or PA government</li>
<li>State or federal laws
or</li>
<li>Relevant cases that might motivate a suggested de facto answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For context, I've tried to search for the answer to these questions, and mostly found via google a slew of articles, blog posts and tutorials written by independent non-government sources, and from those sources I've found a few different answers, even among the reputable-looking sources. I'm looking for evidence that can make one confident that a particular answer is correct, if such an answer exists. The closest I have come is finding official-ish looking sources that mention the issue, but don't stipulate an exact requirement.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ul>
<li>This handbook from the PA attorney general's office: <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nonprofitbooklet.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nonprofitbooklet.pdf</a> says</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to
avoid the appearance of impropriety, it is best not to give
one individual too much control over the corporation. [...] A corporation may have as
many officers with as many different titles as it deems
necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which suggests an nonprofit corp. with one board member might come under scrutiny or be frowned upon. However, it's unclear to me what relation this document has to the actual law, aside from of course reflecting the opinions of one individual who is involved with upholding it in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>This document: <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=15&div=0&chpt=57" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=15&div=0&chpt=57</a> seems to reference part of PA state law (but maybe I've been duped and this is just some person's website...), and Subchapter C Section 5723. seems to explicitly discuss my question. It states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The board of directors of a nonprofit corporation shall consist of one or more members. The number of directors shall be fixed by or in the manner provided in the bylaws. If not so fixed, the number of directors shall be the same as that stated in the articles or three if no number is so stated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which seems to suggest 1 director may form a perfectly valid board for a PA nonprofit corporation.</p>
<p>I have not found the official documentation or guidance for any relevant IRS regulations pertaining to 501(c)(3) status, only third parties claiming various things about what that guidance is.</p>
<p>Any help on these questions would be much appreciated!</p>

      <BODY><p>I'm just starting to get into law studies as a highschooler, and here in the USA, in the state of Maine specifically, they have a system of voting called "Ranked-Choice". Now, from what I can tell, ranked choice works like this:</p>

<p>Say we have 3 candidates running for an office, John, Jane, and Joe. John gets 23% of the votes, Jane receives 35% of the votes, and Joe receives 42% of the votes. Keep in mind these votes come from <em>the first choice</em> of all the voters. Since no one candidate has a majority vote, what happens next is that the candidate with the lowest amount of votes--in this case, John--is put out of the running. At that point, any voters who voted for John have their ballots recounted, and their <em>second choice vote gets added to that candidate's total.</em> Now, from what I can see, this violates the "One person, One vote" precedent set by SCOTUS, as the people who voted for the lowest minority <em>effectively get a second vote.</em></p>

      <TITLE>Can a private chat conversation about someone be considered defamation?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I recently commented on a Facebook post of a friend and suddenly got messaged by someone who was involved in the post.
This person is in fact part of my social circle, however we are not close, we just share friends.
This person stated that, one of the person's involved in that post, was a "disgusting pedophile"(this was not out of the blue however, we talked about other subjects before that).
I, personally don't know the other person, however when I asked why didn't he go to the police to report, he promptly changed the subject, then, I kept asking on why that person in particular was a pedophile, since this is a concern to me(I have a small sister who could be endangered, since the accused is part of the same social circle), after that, he blocked me.
Afterwards when talking with some friends, I learned that on several occasions he has made the same accusations about that person, to different people.
Later on, I found out that those two actually don't get along and have a very strong hatred for each other due to political views.</p>

<p>I'm not close to the accuser, and I don't know the accused person. He could in fact, be a pedophile, but, given the lack of evidence and the fact that this person keeps spreading those accusations, could those messages he sent me (and to others) be used as proof of defamation?
I'm heavily considering on sending those to the accused, since this feels the right thing to do.</p>

      <BODY><p>We purchased a condo two weeks ago. We do not have an real estate agent and we end up dealing with the seller's real estate agent directly. </p>

<p>We're told by the seller agent that there are multiple bidders bidding at the same time. We're under the impression that in order to have a shot at the condo we have to waive the following condition. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDTIG.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Which is we can choose to withdrawal the offer after lawyer viewing of the status certificate. </p>

<p>We were hesitate to waive the conditions but the agent says condos are usually fine and he said he checked with the seller and there is nothing to worry about. </p>

<p>After we win the bid our real estate lawyer examined the status certificate and says there's something called Kitec plumbing in the status certificate, which usually costs condo owners 20k to fix this issue. </p>

<p>We're wondering if there's something that I can do from my side? If the seller do not agree to lower the price for 20k is there something that I can do? Thanks. </p>

      <TITLE>Is it worth going to a top law school today?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am looking to finish a B.S. in mathematics next year, and I am at a fork in the road in terms of career options, as I am deciding whether to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics or go to law school.  I have worked very hard in school and have a strong research background with many published math papers, so it is looking like I will be able to get into a top 10/20 math Ph.D. program.  On the other hand, I recently took a practice LSAT test "for fun" as I am also interested in law, and I got a 170, so if I studied I could probably do better.</p>
<p>From what I have read, with an LSAT score in the 170s, a decent GPA, and a background in rigorous high-level research, I should have a decent shot at some of the top law schools.  That said, I have heard in some circles that it is hard to get a job as a lawyer (I am most interested in corporate law), and if I decide to go to law school instead of a math Ph.D., I want to be sure that it is not a dead-end career choice where I would be relegated to doing horrible work with poor pay until my 50's when I get promoted to a more senior role.</p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone here could say if it is worth going into law, particularly when coming from a good law school (and assuming I have a real interest in the subject and enjoy research, etc.).  Is it true that the profession is contracting, and that it could be hard to find a decent job?  Is there decent upward mobility in the profession, or should one expect a sub-60-70k salary for many many years after school?  Is there anyone here that thinks not going into law (ie pursing a Ph.D. instead) is a better choice?</p>

<p>The last paragraph is the one I'm interested in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walmart says the trespass notices issued to the couple prevent them from visiting any Walmart facility for at least one year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm curious about this since it reads as though Walmart is banning the two people from entering the premises because of their political beliefs. A quick Google search indicates this is usually legal in the United States, but not always - in particular California, New York and the District of Columbia <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-employers-discriminate-based-on-political-beliefs-or-affiliation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">disallow such discrimination</a> (this is admittedly not the exact same scenario since it deals with employment, but <a href="https://www.mydoorsign.com/blog/right-to-refuse-service-to-anyone/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this source</a> says the same thing about California). This seems to indicate that at least in these states, walmart cannot ban them from entering their stores.</p>
<p>However the second source above also says that "In general, refusal of service is justified in cases where a customer’s presence interferes with the safety and well-being of other patrons and the establishment itself", and clearly Walmart's other patrons disapproved of these two people. This seems to indicate that Walmart can ban them from entering their stores.</p>
<p>Question: if the two people in the incident go to California and attempt to enter a Walmart store, can Walmart legally prevent them from entering?</p>

      <BODY><p>Following situation: </p>

<p>5 friends started an app together: The idea guy, a designer, backend, android and iOS engineer. The friends worked on the app for roughly a year however the idea guy started getting more and more angry about the project taking too long to finish. Eventually he started threatening us to shut down the project if we don't work faster and tried to replace members.</p>

<p>We refused and he eventually 'stopped' the project by removing access to all servers and cancelled paid accounts to Github and Co (most of them were held by shared accounts where he wasn't even the one paying them)</p>

<p>Now, the 4 of us are not happy about this at all since we worked for 1 year almost every day on this thing and in our opinion this 1 guy does have no right to decide whether the project is dead or not so we want to finish it without him: Put together some money, re-purchase servers and so on. </p>

<p>The idea guy incorporated a real company on paper but none of us signed anything, nor did he pay any of us. There are also no patents or anything like that. (When we asked him a few times to finally get the paperwork done he always avoided the question which seemed to be like he never really intended of sharing anything with us from the beginning.) The idea guy also mentioned very strongly that this idea is his property and he will pursue legal actions if we do anything without him. </p>

<p>Certain assets like sounds, a few graphics and the project name were created by him which is obviously his IP. If we were to remove this, could the 4 of us legally continue with the project under a different name? </p>

<p>Now to my understanding I am the data controller of my website, and the hosting company is the data processor of the IP data of the visitors (they store it on their servers and might do some statistics, but I never touch this data). An EU paper on GDPR states the following (page 11, 12 of

<blockquote>
<p>The separate question then arises of whether the processor is processing in the context of its
establishment in the Union. If so, the processor will be subject to GDPR processor obligations under
Article 3(1). However, this does not cause the non-EU controller to become subject to the GDPR
controller obligations. That is to say, a “non-EU” controller (as described above) will not become
subject to the GDPR simply because it chooses to use a processor in the Union.</p>

<p>Presuppose that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/11/09/why-doctors-still-dont-text-or-email-their-patients/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">your surgeon doesn't email with patients</a>,  you formed an oral contract with the Dr perfectly, and you recorded it as a WAV audio file. Indubitably it's a valid contract, and evidenced electronically or digitally – but not in writing. But if the audio file is un-enforce-able, then your WAV file is useless!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we have already seen in Chapter 1,1 the general principle is that contracts may be made
entirely orally, no matter how valuable or important the subject matter of the contract may
be. However, there are some exceptions to the general rule that no written formalities are
required, and this chapter will examine two classes of contract. The first encompasses particular
categories of contract which must be in writing as a result of legislation. The second
concerns certain types of contract which are not enforceable unless evidenced in writing.
It should be noted straight away that there are important differences between the two classes.
As regards the first, the ‘contract’ will be void if not in writing. But as regards the second class
of contract, <strong>any contract will be valid but simply unenforceable</strong> if not evidenced in writing.
This means that, where a contract is made orally, neither party can sue on it unless and until
a party can produce the appropriate written evidence of it. Such evidence may come into
existence after the contract has been made.</p>

<ul>
<li>What license should I use if I don't want software to be shared at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me explain the use case:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are creating a software product that is partly being licensed to our client, but there are other parts which we do not want to be licensed or shared at all.  We want it to be proprietary.  I understand that we can and should simply hide it.  That is what we're planning on doing.  But I would also like to establish a license somewhere to explicitly say that everything associated with the packages under this area are not to be shared, and if they somehow came across it, that was mistaken.

<ul>
<li>(I.e., while keeping things secret is best, at least letting folks know they should never have seen it is a nice fallback.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What about measurements of fictional worlds? Many games contain tabular data that describe how elements of the game interact with the rules. Does it matter if the quantities being measured have real-world units or not? For example, 1st edition AD&D has tables of weapon properties, such as length, weight, price, speed factor, damage dice, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3a3zsm/add_1e_what_are_armor_class_adjustment_and_to_hit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">armor class adjustments</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming that I design my own arrangement and appearance, is fictional data covered by copyright (regardless of fair use)?</p>

      <TITLE>Statutes of limitations and the pre-action protocol (PAP)</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Suppose A has a claim against B and the statute of limitations stipulates that it must be brought to the court within 2 years.</p>
<p>Suppose 23,7 months elapse so there is still time (precisely 0,3 months -- less than two weeks) to bring the claim to the court, however, the court expects one to have first gone through the PAP which often allows the respondent 2 weeks to reply to the claimant's first letter.</p>
<p>The claimant no longer has time to send a PAP-Letter Before Claim, but they are still within the statutorily allowed timeframe to bring the claim before the court.</p>
<p>What is the claimant expected to do in this situation? Give the respondent a shortened allowance of time in which to respond to their letter that would still expire within the time limit for the claimant to go to court lest they fail to come to a solution between themselves? File the claim with the court before the deadline to do so while still waiting for the respondent to have their full customary 14 days and the eat the cost of the court filing fee if it proves to be unnecessary due to successful amicable settlement of the matter through the pre-action protocol whilst awaiting the court to list the cause in its calendar? Or something altogether different from both of these options?</p>

      <BODY><p>I'm a US citizen, and I want my young son's and newborn daughter's Chinese grandparents (without green cards) to be able to visit and take care of them in the near future. They don't speak English, so quarantining for 14 days in a 3rd country would not only be expensive (hotel stay plus extra air travel) but also quite challenging for them. So I read the proclamation:</p>
<p><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/</a></p>
<p>I read that guardians of US citizens are excluded from the travel ban.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 2.  Scope of Suspension and Limitation on Entry.</p>
<p>(a)  Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply to:</p>
<p>(i)     any lawful permanent resident of the United States;</p>
<p>(ii)    any alien who is the spouse of a U.S. citizen or lawful
permanent resident;</p>
<p><strong>(iii)   any alien who is the parent or legal guardian of a U.S.
citizen</strong> or lawful permanent resident, provided that the U.S. citizen
or lawful permanent resident is unmarried and under the age of 21;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I'm trying to understand what constitutes a <strong>legal guardian</strong>. Is that determined by the individual states, or is there a Federal take on what constitutes a <strong>legal guardian</strong>?</p>
<p>Connecticut, where I live, in addition to permanent guardians, has both <a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/law/guardianship.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">temporary guardians and standby guardians</a>. From my reading of the CT rules, it seems we couldn't appoint the grandparents as permanent guardians without one of us parents abdicating our parental rights. But it seems there's nothing stopping us from appointing the grandparents as temporary or standby guardians. The question is, would that be sufficient to make the travel ban not applicable to them?</p>
<p>In all likelihood they would be flying into NY, not CT. Does that change the legal guardianship restrictions?</p>
<p>I waited 90 minutes to talk to National Visa Center on the phone but they were not very helpful. They seemed to imply that it would be up to airport or airline (I didn't hear clearly) whether the guardianship papers would be accepted. Thanks for any input you have.</p>

      <BODY><p>Person A commits an offence on January 1st. The police force have everything they need to charge person A within a few days.</p>

<p>Assuming there is no more evidence they can possibly obtain, would they hold off on pressing charges? say, for three or more years.</p>

<p>Surely they would want to move forward as soon as possible? since memories, data and other evidence may degrade (service providers are only bound to keep message records for 12 months ).</p>

<p>I have never heard of this happening, it seems like as soon as they have enough to charge they go right ahead. This seems the correct course of action in terms of the alleged victims of the crime "getting it over and done with".</p>

<p>This is fundamentally different to someone holding off from pressing charges (i.e the many victims of Jimmy Savile). </p>

<p>Examples</p>

<ul>
<li>Hate Crime:
I can not think why there would be delays on a Hate Crime charge. Once there is sufficient evidence to lay charges in this case, then why would a police force hold off on charging?</li>

      <TITLE>Would a judge release a potential Juror who's only complaint was that he didn't want to be a juror?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>From what I have heard of the selection process for jury duty it seems as if anyone who makes an argument for why they can't or shouldn't be a juror is excused by the judge, no matter how flimsy the argument.   I assume the reason judges are so lenient with exceptions is because they don't want to risk a juror being resentful of their position, as it could bias them against one side or keep them from putting in a proper good faith effort to fulfill their responsibility as a juror.</p>

<p>I'm wondering how far a judge would take that mindset.  Are they willing to let a juror go just to avoid resentment if the juror otherwise has no excuse to not be a juror?</p>

<p>So hypothetically Lets say that I am called for Jury duty tomorrow and I don't want to be a juror.  There are plenty of ways I'm sure I could get myself dismissed; From the obviously like constantly shouting "hang them all" to the more 'subtle' like giving a dissertation on why I think jury nullification is such a swell idea.  However, lets say I am unwilling to do anything remotely unethical and admit I don't have any valid reason I should be dismissed as a juror. However, I tell the judge despite this fact I really don't want to be a juror because I think it would be boring and I prefer to sleep in on the mornings.</p>

<p>What are the odds the judge would let me go anyways, just to avoid having an unwilling juror?</p>

      <TITLE>Insider trading due to mis-sent email?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Something that happened to a friend recently. This friend is in charge of negotiations for company A. An individual from company B, accidentally sent my friend minutes from a recent meeting outlining a lot of information that can be useful for my friend in company A during the negotiations. Naturally, if he were to use information it could be construed as insider trading (a rather serious offense).</p>

<p>A point of interest is that in the email from company B a disclaimer was attached stating the usual: "if this went to the wrong sender then don't read it, only intended for internal use, blah blah."</p>

<p>Now two points I found interesting, and correct me if I am wrong: the disclaimer isn't legally binding e.g. there is no two-party consent - its one sided. Secondly, one could assume a perfectly ethical individual would not have looked at the email any further after understanding what the contents of that email contained, should they have not noticed that it was not intended for them.</p>

<p>Thus, my question. Say company A and B were negotiating on a price. Company's B minutes state on the first line of the email that their max price is 100. Company A was willing to sell for 70. My friend, having read the first line may not choose to act on the information in the document so as to avoid insider trading, however, it is hard to deny the fact that having read that document he will negotiate differently at even a subliminal level. It's like in poker, you know the other persons hand through a reflection in the mirror. Would my friend be acting in an illegal manner?</p>

<p>Full disclosure: this is for my own curiosity. My friend is already consulting the companies lawyer, and informed company B of the email.</p>

      <BODY><p>I work for an organization that holds a consultation agreement with a company. I work for the organization and directly assist the company. However, I will be the only employee working on the project (who happens to have extensive knowledge of the project, and hiring a new person would be costly). If I were to work directly for the company, it would cut many costs for them. </p>

<p>Currently their consultation agreement has no termination clauses, so from what I understand they can cancel within a reasonable notice. However, if I submitted a two week's notice to resign from the organization I work for, would the company be able to cancel the contract on terms that the organization failed to provide? I know this sounds a little evil, but it is honestly a positive benefit because the organization is taking very unfair advantage of the company. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: additional info, I am the only employee after another major employee of the organization left due to improper management that had some affect on the company.  </p>

      <TITLE>In which states can railroad companies take land in eminent domain?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>In <em>Property</em>, fifth edition, by Dukeminier and Krier, on pages 843–54, we are told that in Vermont, railroad companies have the power of eminent domain: they can take land that they need for building tracks. What they take is an easement, but it seems just barely short of fee simple: the land reverts to the permanent owner or successor only if the railroad stops running trains along the track and thereby abandons the easement, but until then it seems to be entirely theirs. Railroads seem to continue operating on a particular track for well over a century sometimes.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>In which states in the U.S. do railroads have this power?</li>
<li>Might that be the reason why many railroad rights-of-way are held in easement rather than in fee simple?</li>

      <TITLE>Enforcement of agreement by subsequent party</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am trying to get my head around how the law perceives and deals with an element of how countries deal with contractual obligations where the contracting parties change.  The specific case is this</p>
<p>Party A limited trading as A enters into an agreement with party B to perform work for them.</p>
<p>Party A limited subsequently sells their business to party C (and stops trading).</p>
<p>Party C continues the business "trading as" A.   Party A neglects to send formal notice to party B advising that they have sold their business and obligations to party C</p>
<p>Party C works with party B and performs the obligations and of party A.  Party C then bills party B.   Party B refuses to pay (but does not specify the reason for their refusal) Party C sues party B for non payment in a disputes tribunal, and it is only at this point that party C discovers the reason for non-payment.</p>
<p>Party A and Party C are willing to work together to recover the debt from party B.   If Party C amends their filing, does party A become a joint applicant, a third party or something else?  Does Party A need to make a demand on party B and restart the whole application?</p>

      <TITLE>Why does Section 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms prohibit sex discrimination redundantly?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>In the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/ConstRpt/page-12.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>, Section 28 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Rights guaranteed equally to both sexes</h3>
<p><strong>28</strong> Notwithstanding anything in this Charter, the rights and freedoms referred to in it are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section doesn't actually grant any rights or freedoms.  It merely says that any rights and freedoms mentioned elsewhere in the Charter apply equally to males and females.</p>
<p>But doesn't Section 15 already cover sex equality?</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Equality before and under law and equal protection and benefit of law</h3>
<p><strong>15 (1)</strong> Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If 15(1) already grants equal protection and equal benefit of the law regardless of sex, and the Charter is part of the law, then why reiterate that principle in Section 28?  Is there any court case in which an argument or ruling hinged on the existence of Section 28?  Or, was there a reason why the equal application of the Charter to both sexes needed to be made explicitly clear?</p>

      <TITLE>Can I buy 2 earthquake policies on the same home?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I live in a state with stupidly expensive state-sponsored earthquake insurance. To get a 5% deductible, I basically have to buy 1/10 of a house over my lifetime... but the chance of losing my home to an earthquake over that timeframe is only 1/500. But then I noticed that for half the cost, I could buy a policy with a 20% deductible on the full value, and then a second policy with a 20% deductible on 20% of the value. To effectively get a 4% deductible.... at almost half the cost. Because of the lower deductible, the premium on the first policy drops by half. The second policy is 1/5 of that.</p>
<p>The payout with these two new policies is as good as one policy with a 4% deductible. For example, if the home is destroyed, then I collect 80% of the home value from policy 1, and another 16% of the home value from policy 2. So, in total, I get 96% of the value, just as in a 4% deductible plan. Neither policy is paying out any more or less than it would have if I had just one of the two new policies. So I am not causing any harm to either insurer by having the other one. Right?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, double-insuring things is legal. For example, I can insure stocks or mortgages that I don't own, and I can have 15 life insurance policies. Nonetheless, I have to ask: is there any potential legal issue with doubling up on earthquake insurance? Is it somehow illegal to attempt to avoid getting ripped off by the state?</p>

      <TITLE>Authority of opposite decision on international law of other U.S. court of appeals in state court in instant circuit court</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Say the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit decides that the provision of a self-executing, ratified-by-the-U.S. international treaty which provides for an individual right does not provide such individual right. However, the Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit decides (at a later time) that the treaty does indeed provide for an individual right in the U.S..</p>
<p>Is there, preferably a U.S. Supreme Court decision, or any other case law that decided that the newer circuit court decision relating to federal (or more narrowly relating  to international law) should enjoy a rebuttable presumption to be correct over the older one or any case that decided that the circuit court with geographic jurisdiction should enjoy such a presumption regardless of its precedence or antecedence? Or else, is there anything similar that at least decided this question for the geographic jurisdiction of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, that is, is there such a precedent that declares it’s own authority in federal (or more narrowly) international law matters over the decisions of the U.S. court of appeals for any other circuit?</p>
<p>I understand that such out-of-circuit cases may be cited without a problem, and they will definitely have persuasive authority (unlike, for e.g. generally unpublished decisions), but the question is whether geographic or the temporal instancy in opposing decisions makes one over the other binding authority.</p>

      <TITLE>Are you vicariously liable to someone you hired to carry out a negligent act?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Vicarious liability holds that when an employee is negligent and causes damage in the course of work, the employer is held liable. What if the "work" itself is negligent, and the damage brought about by negligence harms the very person hired for the negligent act?</p>
<h2>Example Case</h2>
<p>For example, let's assume that <strong>Fred</strong> hires <strong>Barney</strong> to stage a fake attack during a self-defense class so that Fred can demonstrate a self-defense technique. Barney is therefore paid to act as Fred's attacker, and they have agreed on a safe plan to conduct this training session. None of the students are informed of this and it hasn't happened in the class before.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, Barney storms in through the open door and attempts to attack Fred with a training knife. One of the students, <strong>Uriah</strong>, intervenes and severely injures Barney due to thinking the sudden attack without warning is real. Fred neither injures nor is himself injured.</p>
<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>While I don't think Uriah would be liable (as a reasonable person would think Barney is a real attacker), would Fred be liable to Barney? Would the fact that Fred and Barney were <em>both</em> involved in a negligent plan be a factor?</p>
<p>Note: The United States is the jurisdiction, but various jurisdictions within the United States would factor in contributory negligence vs. compensatory negligence. I would be interested in hearing how both philosophies would play into the above scenario.</p>

      <TITLE>When a contract is being analyzed in court, is it the understanding of the parties or the written contract that is to be established?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This is a difficult question to phrase so bare with me. From reading questions on this site, I understand that a written contract (e.g. a lease) is only a written record of the actual contract, that is to say the understood "abstract" contract takes precedence. So someone can't argue something silly like "the contract said I must pay them $100 but never specified the currency". But in complex situations, different parties may have different interpretations of the contract, even after signing it in writing. Just because something is in writing doesn't mean it's clear.</p>

<p>My question is, isn't it wrong to think that in court the judge and jury are trying to establish the actual understood contract? It is very well possible that the parties were not on the same page when the contract was formed. If this were the case, then what is the job of the judge/jury?</p>

<p>For example if Bob and Joe are going to court because Bob believes Joe owes him $100 in accordance with a contract they both signed, but Joe believes he doesn't, if the contract really is ambiguous and both Joe and Bob really do believe they are in the right, what is the job of the Judge and Jury? You can't really say it's to find out who was right because there was a misunderstanding when the contract was formed - but I don't think that invalidates the contract because businesses do this all the time to rip people off for money :P</p>

<p>Is it possible the a judge/jury actually decides who wins the case based on the judge's/jury's own interpretation of the contract and not the plantiff's or defendant's? </p>

<p>UPDATE: sorry for the confusing question, I think what I was trying to get at is what happens when a party finds an "alternative" interpretation to a clause before agreeing to it, so they can find a loophole if/when a dispute arises. I think large corporations do this a lot.</p>

<p>I also would like to potentially make a quote of a song at the beginning of each chapter; for example:</p>
<p>"I bet a million to one, that there's a face in the fire that burns in the sun" would be quoted from Jan hammer's "Seeds Of Life" in the header of chapter 1, and I would like to quote a "One Eskimo" song (astronauts) as chapter 2's header, which takes place in space from another character's viewpoint.</p>

<p>I am willing to potentially purchase licenses if needed or just re-write my story to exclude the quotes, but I am wondering if perhaps this usage of song lyrics falls under fair use, since in a way I am transforming the songs by including small portions of them as part of the storytelling.</p>

      <BODY><p>Recently, I got hold of a contract with a rather strange term:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that this document is written to be as broad and inclusive as legally permitted by the State of California. I agree that if any portion is held invalid or unenforceable, I will continue to be bound by the remaining terms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this actually possible? How can I be bound by a contract that's been found to be invalid? And, by proxy, how can I actually escape a contract like this?</p>

<p>I thought GDPR was to protect the data/information of EU citizens (from Wikipedia):</p>

      <TITLE>Bar Admissions Geography</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>New York Judiciary Law § 478 makes it illegal to practice law <strong>in</strong> New York state.  I imagine that there is some law defining what constitutes practicing "in" the state, and that questions probably involve whether they are advising people in the state and whether they are located in the state while advising.</p>

<p>My question is: does any law prohibit an attorney who is admitted in New York from practicing the law of other jurisdictions, while that attorney is <strong>in</strong> New York state.</p>

<p>Obviously one must meet certain criteria (admission, pro hac vice, etc) to <em>appear</em> in court in another State as an attorney.  But is it correct to assume that an Admitted Lawyer can practice the law of any jurisdiction, so long as they do so from within their home state?</p>

<p>Additional wrinkles:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I vaguely remember something about it being the <em>primary</em> place you practice, such that (some/most) states don't prohibit an admitted New York attorney from occasionally providing advice in their state.</p></li>
<li><p>I am interested in international jurisdictions as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I imagine my assumption must be right, because a New York attorney is certainly not constrained from interpreting a contract with a Texas choice of law clause, so long that attorney does so in the context of practicing in New York.</p></li>

      <BODY><p>A comment on <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/q/80132/508">the recent question about the possibility of U.S. laws in Spanish</a> mentioned an assumption that Puerto Rican law would be mostly in Spanish.</p>
<p>Not being familiar with Puerto Rican law, this comment just made me curious whether or not that assumption is correct. Are Puerto Rican laws indeed written primarily (or entirely) in Spanish? Or are they written primarily or entirely in English? Or are they written in both in parallel?</p>
<p>It seems that having them written in Spanish only would be problematic for federal court cases arising from them, since the federal courts (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/48/864" rel="noreferrer">including the one in Puerto Rico</a>) would be conducting any proceedings in the English language - and comparing the Puerto Rican laws with U.S. federal law and existing case law, which are also in English. On the other hand, having laws that much of the local populace couldn't read would also be problematic.</p>
<p>(As background for those who may not be familiar with Puerto Rico, it is a territory of the United States, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Puerto_Rico" rel="noreferrer">Spanish is by far the primary local language there</a>.)</p>

      <TITLE>If vampires were real, what would one who broke into someone's home to drink their blood be charged with?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This question is of course entirely hypothetical, but I am curious as to what crimes would be applicable in this situation. Alternatively, you could interpret the question as: If someone pretending to be a vampire broke into someone's home, drained at least one person's blood nonconsensually, and escaped undetected, what could the perpetrator's charges be if caught?</p>
<hr />
<p>For clarity's sake, I can mention that this particular question came about in reference to the villains from the videogame Gabriel Knight 3, who are nominally vampires but turn out to be pretty different from the 'traditional' definition and so lack pretty much any of the mythical weaknesses or restrictions associated to them (they also lack any kind of communicable 'vampiric condition', but are merely humans who have greatly extended their lifespans by stealing and drinking magical blood).</p>
<p>One additional detail it didn't occur to me to mention earlier is that to escape detection, they use magic to put everyone in the vicinity into a deep sleep, which in a more realistic frame I suppose could be equated to something like nonconsensual administration of hypnotic psychoactive drugs. Based on what's been said I'd think something like that would also fall under assault, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Yet, contradictorily, I also see major websites doing this. For example on Twitch, when a subscription is 'gifted' to the community, a community member (a user who has ever, at no cost, watched or interacted with the streamer’s streams) is selected (somewhat randomly) to receive it.</p>
<p>How does the law look differently upon a website that gives away something randomly as opposed to a software process (like Twitch's) that randomly selects someone to give a reward to?</p>

      <TITLE>Roommate caused water damage to our condo, what are my options?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I live with 3 roommates and all 4 of us are on a lease for the condo owned by our landlord. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> my roommate "Jim" caused water damage to several rooms and I'm looking for advice on what I can personally do since none of the damage was directly my fault. </p>

<p>Full story:
The sink in the bathroom on the second floor doesn't drain and we have been unable to use it without the sink filling up with water. The previous landlord knew about the plumbing issues and our current landlord was made aware of this problem when ownership of the condo was transferred to them. In the past few months since then, the landlord hasn't taken any steps to fix it, so my roommate "Tom" started to work on it himself in an attempt to clear the blockage. </p>

<p>Tom disassembled the pipe directly under the sink and for whatever reason was unable to fix the problem and left everything disassembled for a few days while he tried to come up with a solution. Every one of us knew NOT to run the faucet and to use the first floor bathroom sink instead. No problems for a few days.</p>

<p>However, Jim ended up using the sink on the second floor and <em>left the faucet running for at least 2 hours</em>. The water had nowhere to go but out the pipe and onto the bathroom floor. And over the course of those 2 hours the water went through the ceiling of the first floor (it was pouring out of the ceiling when we discovered it) and continued to leak down into the basement. The ceiling is deformed due to water damage and I can only assume there is still water in the ceiling of the first floor and the basement. I'm sure it's safe to assume there could be water in the walls, too.</p>

<p>Clearly there will have to be a lot of work done (and money spent) to fix the damage. From what I understand of the lease, the landlord won't care whose fault it is and will expect us to collectively pay him back for the repairs? As I did not cause any of the damage, what options do I have to protect myself and minimize the amount of money that I will have to pay? Do I hope for the landlord to have mercy on me, do I take this to court (I wouldn't expect to win as there is no proof it wasn't my fault), do I take my roommate(s) to small claims court, or am I just SOL?</p>

<p>Edit: I don't have renter's insurance and I'm unsure of what my landlord's insurance situation is.</p>

Unfortunately, nothing has been done expect empty promises that I should continue to call the police so they can make a tight case to evict them. </p>

<p>My understanding is that in Texas you don't need so much police reports and accumulating incidents, one violation is enough. So I feel like I was stringed along and sure enough the real estate company sold the apartment complex to another company and the problem persists.</p>

Burden shifts to defendant to rebut the presumption by showing that defendant acted as a reasonable person.  If defendant does not rebut, defendant loses on duty and breach. Defendant may show excuse</p>

<p>AUTHORITY 3: The violation of the statute is <strong>merely evidence of the duty and breach</strong> which may be ignored by the trier of fact.  Defendant can win even if there is no rebuttal</p>

<p>Regarding authority 1, what is the point of showing excuse if the trial goes on to causation and damages anyways?</p>

<p>Regarding authority 2, what is the point of showing excuse after failure to rebut results in defendant losing on duty and breach?</p>

<li><p>As she wrote 'survivor', did someone die?</p>

<li><p>Is "<strong>receipt</strong>" here like a receipt from a department store?</p>

<li><p>Why is this factor — that "<strong>the survivor was authorised to give a receipt for the capital moneys</strong>" — relevant, in  determining if the joint legal owners had a common intention
that their beneficial interests should differ from their legal interests?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Martin Dixon, <em>Modern Land Law</em> (12 edn, 2021, OUP), p. 182.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>4.10.6.1.3 Route 3: inferred common intention from the parties’ entire course of conduct</h3>
<p>The majority judgment in <em>Stack</em> (Lord Neuberger disagreeing in part as to the reasoning) sets out to make it easier for a claimant to establish a common intention and thereby an equitable interest in land belonging to another. The <em>Stack</em> reasoning is adopted and approved in <em>Kernott</em> and has since been adopted in acquisition cases as indicated above. The essence of the matter is that it is permissible to infer<sup>199</sup> a common intention as to ownership based on the parties’ entire relationship with each other. It was not necessary to limit the enquiry to promises or payments. The evidence for this common intention can come from a range of factors because, according to Baroness Hale in <em>Stack</em> (who gave the leading judgment and which is approved explicitly in <em>Kernott</em>), ‘context is everything’.<sup>200</sup>  Thus, to establish a common intention it is possible to rely on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Dixon quotes from the second sentence of para. 69 by Lady Hale in <a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2007/17.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Stack v. Dowden (Respondent)</em> [2007] UKHL 17</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many more factors than financial contributions may be relevant to divining the parties' true intentions. These include: any advice or discussions at the time of the transfer which cast light upon their intentions then; the reasons why the home was acquired in their joint names; the reasons why (if it be the case) <strong>the survivor was authorised to give a receipt for the capital moneys</strong>; the purpose for which the home was acquired; the nature of the parties' relationship; whether they had children for whom they both had responsibility to provide a home; how the purchase was financed, both initially and subsequently; how the parties arranged their finances, whether separately or together or a bit of both; how they discharged the outgoings on the property and their other household expenses. [I skip rest of para. 69.]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>199 In <em>Stack</em>, there is some argument as to whether this intention is an ‘inferred’ or ‘imputed’ intention. Lord Neuberger is happy to infer an intention, but not to impute one. An inferred intention is a real intention that arises from the facts; an imputed intention is one that the court thinks the parties would have had, had they thought about it. Inferred common intention has the approval of precedent, but imputed intentions were rejected by the House of Lords in <em>Gissing v Gissing</em> (1971). <em>Kernott</em> makes it clear that this is inferred intention. It is now clear that the court cannot impute an intention in either acquisition or quantifcation/variation disputes (<em>Capehorn v Harris, Barnes v Phillips</em> (2015)), although some cases are still unclear in their reasoning (<em>Rothschild v De Souza</em> (2018)).</p>
<p>200 <em>Stack v Dowden</em> at paragraph 69. The same point is made in <em>Marr v Collie</em> (2017).</p>

      <TITLE>Isn't a lease violation enough to evict someone in Texas?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I made the mistake of picking one of the worst apartment complexes an educated nuclear family can choose in the state of Texas.</p>

<p>I have reported problem neighbors in the past and have been told, "thanks, we will send them a lease violation". And it is just now that I am reading through a Tenant Council fact sheet that says any infraction of the lease in Texas is grounds for eviction.</p>

<p>Well, I had one neighbor shine a laser light on my chest, shine that same laser light through my bedroom window where I sleep with my child and spouse at 1am in the morning to the extent I have a police report, but yet it still was not enough data to evict them. The leasing manager said keep reporting stuff to the police so they have an overwhelming amount of info on to which evict them.</p>

<p>I am starting to get a sense that the message is I am not going to evict someone just because they are being a nuisance to you and lose that money.</p>

<p>Now I am feeling like this leasing manager was pulling my chain all this time. At this point, he is gone, this apartment complex has been bought and sold three times already and I just feel like this stuff can't be legal, the constant buying and selling, the incompetent leasing managers that are put in place, the allowing of everyone and their mother to live on the property even though they are not on the lease which causes a safety issue, the lack of security cameras.</p>

<p>I would like some clarification on what Texas has to say about all this.</p>

      <BODY><p>According to my textbook, there are three ways that a life tenancy with multiple life tenants can be carried out.</p>

<p>(1) Life estate lasts until the last life tenant dies; the share of each survivor increasing by means of a remainder</p>

<p>(2) Life estate lasts until the last tenant dies; <strong>the share of the deceased life tenant passing through her estate</strong></p>

<p>(3) An estate for joint lives; the life estate ending when the first tenant dies</p>

<p>Can you tell me what the bolded part for (2) would look like? It looks like it is trying to say that the heirs of the life tenant will inherit it after the life tenant dies. How is that any different from a Fee Simple Absolute?</p>

      <BODY><p>What can an individual do to get someone prosecuted (apart from reporting the matter to the police and giving testimony)? What if the police is reluctant to give traction?</p>

<p>If this question is too general, let's scope it down to intentional damage to property in New Zealand (up to 7 years, <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/137.0/DLM330702.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">S269(2)(a) Crimes Act 1961</a>) and/or reckless ill-treatment of animals (up to 3 years, S28A <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0142/59.0/DLM3094404.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Animal Welfare Act 1999</a>).</p>

<p>Important thing to note that the individual wishing to prosecute <strong>is not</strong> the owner of the damaged property, therefore civil claim probably cannot work here.</p>

<p><strong>Use-case scenario</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>There is a domestic animal owned by A, living on B's property and wandering in the neighbourhood;</li>
<li>B loves/feeds the animal, so does his neighbour C and many other neighbours except for D;</li>
<li>One day the animal enjoys sunshine at D's property which is a huge empty paddock — quite far away from D's house but very close to B's and C's;</li>
<li>D arrives in his car bringing over his hunting dog to where the animal is;</li>
<li>The dog starts pursuing the animal (still on D's property) and, just as the animal runs on the street, kills it there;</li>
<li>D leaves the animal dead, gets his dog back in the car and drives away;</li>
<li>B and C, frustrated by what happened and grieving for the animal, want to prosecute D. The actual owner (A) does not care.</li>

      <TITLE>Where is the rule guidance on implementing the Collin's amendment?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><em>BACKGROUND</em></p>

<p>The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into United States federal law by President Barack Obama on July 21, 2010. Section 171 known as the Collins amendment states:</p>

<p><em>Minimum risk-based capital requirements:</em>
The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall establish minimum risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors. <em>The minimum risk-based capital requirements established under this paragraph shall not be less than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements, which shall serve as a floor for any capital requirements that the agency may require, nor quantitatively lower than the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements</em> that were in effect for insured depository institutions as of the date of enactment of this Act.</p>

<p><strong>I need to locate detailed guidance on calculation of the above mentioned risk based capital requirements.</strong></p>

<p>I found the below reference for Dodd Frank:</p>

<p>Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, codified in relevant part at 12 U.S.C. § 5301, §§ 5481-5603, and in laws amended (Title X); and 12 U.S.C. § 5481 note, 15 U.S.C. § 1601 note, § 1602, and § 1631 et seq. (Title XIV) </p>

<p>I'm translating this as:
Public Law number 111 to 203, statute 1376. Title 12 of the United States Code, chapters xx, etc.</p>

<p>I understand that when a bill is signed into law by the President it is sent to the Office of the Federal Register to be assigned a law number and paginated for the United States Statutes at Large. Afterwards, a List of Public Laws is created, posted online, and then published in the Federal Register which I understand to be the official journal of the federal government of the United States that contains government agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.</p>

<p>USC Title 12 and Statute 1376 are very high level. No details/guidance on the calculation of the floor that they rule on. No breakout of how credit risk, market risk, operational risk fit into the calculation for example. I'm currently reviewing the federal register but making very slow progress.</p>

<p><em>QUESTIONS</em></p>

<p>Is there a guidance manual such as the MPEP in Patent Law that accompanies USC Title 12?</p>

<p>What is the next level of publications down? I am looking for publications with more detail and granular discussion of implementation of the laws in the USC and Statute.</p>

<p>In Statute 1376, it's title is "124 STAT. 1376". What does the 124 reference? Is that a grouping of Statutes? Banking for example? </p>

      <BODY><p>The employer of one of my family members owes several thousand dollars in unpaid wages, which is documented in the employer's books. The family is considering legal action and they want to demand copies of the books as evidence (the employer never provided any formal pay stubs). The state (Pennsylvania) does have laws requiring employers to permit inspection and copying of payroll documents. However, there is significant concern that the employer (a rather sleazy independent contractor) may simply destroy or doctor the books to hide what is owed.</p>

<p>So, my question is two-fold: Are there any legal tools to allow an employee to obtain copies of his payroll documents without giving the employer an opportunity to destroy said documents, and what sort of repercussions would an employer face for destroying payroll documentation after a request for copies has been made?</p>

X writes a letter of recommendation for her student mr. Y, and sends it to university Z through an on-line system. Then, the student mr. Y writes an official letter to university Z asking to see all the personal data stored about him. University Z is in Europe, so GDPR applies.</p>

<p>The letter contains some of mr. Y's personal data (his full name, for instance). On the other hand, the letter is a text written by prof. X, and she retains full copyright over it and can prevent further redistribution.</p>

<p>What should University Z do in this case? Do they have an obligation to show the recommendation letter to the student? Is there a solution that does not infringe anyone's rights?</p>

      <TITLE>Audio Recordings as Evidence</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I have many a times seen people deal with their Stock Brokers telling them to sell or buy shares and as the prices fluctuate quite quickly they don't have the time to get everything in writing. I once asked one such person and they said the broker would keep an Audio Recording of the conversation as evidence of having been told to perform the transaction however is this evidence even valid? I believe it can easily be fabricated by someone. Also someone after losing money might just go and say that I didn't give the order and that my phone was stolen or something. Are there precedents for such incidents? How does the court rule then?</p>

      <BODY><p>For some background: the EU "[Data Protection Directive][1]" is a European Union directive which regulates the processing of personal data within the European Union, as explained in [this Wikipedia article][2]. Among these regulations is the rule that individuals have right for a copy of the data that has been collected about them.</p>

<p>The question is, what about cases such as an EU citizen who is in United States on, say, a temporary 2-year work assignment sent by their employer? Let's say that during his stay in USA he becomes a member of an international organization that stores some details about him, or creates an account at some website that gathers information about his online behavior.</p>

<li><p>No, I didn't hit A. His injuries were caused by a fall.</p>

<p>Do these defenses have different "supporting" requirements, e.g. different burdens of proof? Or if B claims 1) are there things like "reasonableness" tests? E.g. If the "knife" had been a child's plastic knife instead of one with a steel blade, could B's defense be weakened to a degree that is not possible for the other defenses?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That we freely offer, grant, and dedicate to those who may purchase
said property or any part thereof and to the general public, the use
of the streets and roads shown on said plat of property for public
use. That we freely offer, grant, and dedicate to those who may rent
or purchase said property or any part thereof, and to their invitees
or guests and to all government service vehicles and general service
vehicles, such as fire, police, garbage, mail, etc. the use of the
private drives as shown on said plat of property. That we shall be
responsible for maintenance of the private drives as shown on said
plat unless we require by recorded covenant running with the land the
subsequent owners to be responsible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one road in the neighborhood, actually just a court (ct) that dead ends at the neighborhood boundary.  This little road doesn't have any homes on it... it's barely 100' long.</p>

<p>Can someone connect a new road to our private roads without our permission?</p>
<p>Since we don't really use the little court that would be used as the connector, could we just dig up the road and turn it into a grassy/wooded space?  Does the fact it's been dedicated to the public restrict us from demolishing it if we wanted to?</p>

<p>PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.</p>

<p>"[Forum] does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, works of authorship, applications, or other materials (collectively, "Third Party Content") that its users post."</p>

<p>However, the next sentence then says:</p>

<p>"By posting Third Party Content to any public area of the Site, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant to [Forum] an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide license to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute said Content and to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, said Third Party Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses (through multiple tiers) of the foregoing."</p>

<p>From my (Very uneducated) understanding, this means that I am still the copyright holder of the (unique) content that I have posted, but the forum has the full rights to display the content, which is a right I cannot revoke.</p>

<p>If I'm the owner of the content, surely I have the right to request its deletion?</p>

<p>When I asked, they said no, however, I'm 100% sure that there's a very fast way to remove all posts at once.</p>

      <BODY><p>Hypothetical: "Alice Corp"(hereafter "A") rents things(what they are should not matter, as much as possible, e.g. not housing units as those tend to be tightly regulated). "Bob B. Borrower" (hereafter "B") is their customer, who rents items from A with a contract, which specifies that the replacement cost of the rented item, should it not be returned in good condition is $100. </p>

<p>B rents something from A for a specified period of time(say 1000 days), at which point he must return it. B is charged $1 a day rental fee. B has the option to return the object before the end of the rental period, in which case, he will only pay a prorated amount based on the time he actually had the item.</p>

<p>The thing is damaged by a lightning storm, an act caught on video by an indisputable source, on day 500 of 1000; therefore, B owes A $100. B goes to pay A on the 1000th day, at which point there is a disagreement. A and B agree that B owes $100 for the replacement fee, as per contract. B holds that he owes $600, $500 for 500 days of use plus $100 for replacement. A maintains that if B paid on the 500th day, $600 would be the correct figure; however, since B neither returned the item nor paid the replacement fee (nor made arrangements to pay in installments, etc.), the rental was still in effect, and so A says B should pay $1100, $1000 for the 1000 days, and $100 for replacement. The barebones contract says nothing about this</p>

<p>Who is correct?</p>

<p>I am now in a position to buy my own house and was under the impression that I only have to give 1 months notice as I thought the contract would now become a periodic tenancy. However the agent from the letting agency was on the phone yesterday to arrange a time to come out and inspect the property and she said "it's actually two months notice that you have to give according to your contract, I'll check with your landlord to see if they are happy to accept one months notice".</p>

      <TITLE>Utility access rights without an easement?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Situation:</strong>
We have a new construction site / home on a small farm. A gas line has been installed across my property, to service the house. I have NO utility easements filed except for an original electric easement on the border. I installed my own electrical buried cable to service the house from a bordering transformer and meter. I let a different utility company install a gas line (because it seemed easier than DIY-ing with a meter at the street). I did sign an installation agreement with this written in the fine print:</p>
<p>"CONDITIONS TO INSTALLATION.
1.1... payment stuff.
2.2 Right-of-Way. Customer shall provide the right-of-way required for the installation of the Company's service facilities. Customer shall grant or obtain for the Company an easement along the route of the line extension in a form satisfactory to the Company."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>
Since I never filed an easement and the utility company never asked (none exists), is it within my rights to deny them access to the property or force them to be more courteous? I completely understand they can shut down the service because technically this could be a breach of our contract for service. However, situations have come up recently (not just meter reading) where trespassing and damage to the property occurred. A security gate is soon to be installed. There is a perimeter fence which will be beefed up as well. They will be physically forced to ask permission (for anything) and I want to know ahead of time, what kind of trouble I can get in or what is typical where they can no longer physically access the property without being courteous.</p>

      <TITLE>sole proprietorship tax question</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This is the first year I am working with a my tax person, and they intend to file for me as described above. My question is about the contract they sent over, which is not that extensive, but the part, which I like to get your comments about is that "...you have the final responsibility for the income tax returns...". Now being a novice, I went back and read my tax returns from previous years, and the associated documents from a very popular if not the most popular tax service here in the States, and I don't see anything similar to it. But they never did SP for me. I am embarrassed to say I know next to nothing about this, and I have already got a book to educate myself in this area. But any advice is greatly appreciated. Am I being overly concerned? Given that I exchanged a number of emails with my current tax person, I wish they had told me ahead of time and perhaps even sent me a copy of the contract they would want me to sign. But it is so short that I am not sure if I am over reacting. What are some requirements for filling a SP income tax? Is it more risky to do? What are the long term requirements for filling SP? Would I be locking myself into anything if I do this? </p>

<p>How does the court distinguish between plagiarism and inspiration in songs? I heard these two and I found they sounded very similar, but weren't completely the same. Is there a set of criteria we can use to judge if a song was plagiarizing another rather than taking inspiration from another song? Does the law allow a composer to heavily borrow from another song without being subject to a lawsuit in the United States?</p>

      <TITLE>Can people use an LLC in Delaware to legally avoid tax in his home country?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Say I am a citizen of Malaysia.</p>

<p>I am thinking of either opening a corporation in Seychelles or Delaware LLC.</p>

<p>As far as I know, both are tax free, cheap, and stuff. Delaware LLC is even cheaper.</p>

<p>Delaware LLC, for tax purpose, is a tax "flow" entities. So if you're an american citizen, you will pay tax as if the income of the LLC is your income.</p>

<p>But what about if you are a citizen in other country? From say, Malaysian's point of view, is delaware LLC any different than Seychelles corporation? Both are just foreign entities right?</p>

<p>Must you pay tax for any income the delaware LLC have? Assuming you don't repatriate, etc.</p>

<p>Note: LLC is a flow through entities. Basically if I were american citizen the tax will flow through as if I don't have LLC. However, given that I am not an american citizen the tax will flow through a foreign entity. From US/Delaware points of view, the tax flow through outside. From my country points of view, an LLC in delaware owns tax. So no body claims they can tax me.</p>

<p>That's the idea.</p>

      <BODY><p>I had a short term job that I was fired from. I was told that someone tripped and was injured on something I left laying around, which in fact I didn't do. As "proof" my manager showed me images of images and a message. I won't get into the details but the "proof" is just ridiculous, the floor in the photo doesn't even match where the event was claimed to have happened. It would seem that my coworkers heard I was fired for this.</p>
<p>Is this defamation? When I asked management why they believed I did this they just say "someone told us".</p>
<p>Another way to phrase the question: does a employer have a responsibility to make some effort to determine if an accusation is true?</p>

      <TITLE>Why is distilled water packaged and sold similar to drinking water in the US but not in other countries?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>In the United States and Canada, distilled water packaging is almost identical to that of drinking water with just minor differences. In other countries such as Israel and Germany, distilled water is sold with very different packaging and usually in the pharmacy or automotive section of stores rather than next to drinking water.</p>
<p>Is there a legal reason why US manufacturers choose to package distilled water and lay out stores this way? It just feels so odd like selling rubbing alcohol and vodka in identical packages and on the same aisle, which I assume is illegal and clearly ill-advised.</p>
<p>Is difference in law between the US and e.g. Germany is what causing this difference in outcome?</p>
<p>Also, I'm sorry if law StackExchange is not the best place to ask this. Please point me at somewhere better.</p>

      <TITLE>Building has been out of hot water for 32 hours</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I currently live in a student residence with another 35 students. On Wednesday night I didn't have hot water and took a cold shower, then, next night I still didn't have hot water. I asked the other tenants if someone else didn't have hot water through the Whatsapp group we have and everyone who answered stated that they also don't have hot water.</p>

<p>This morning (32 hours after Wednesday's night) I informed the landlord of this problem and also encouraged others tenants to do the same.</p>

<p>I know that in most places hot water counts as a plumbing service and the landlord has a time window to fix this problem, after such time some legal actions can be taken.</p>

<p>What are my rights as a tenant of a room when facing this problem? Let's say that he doesn't fix it this weekend because paying a plumber on weekends is more expensive and he prefers to wait until Monday, so he leaves all of us for 3 more days without hot water, what can I do about this?</p>

<p>I'm not an Austrian citizen nor I don't speak German (yet) but I do have a rent contract signed by both parties.</p>

      <TITLE>Does the potential criminal value of objects have any legal uses, such as in tax deductions?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Suppose someone has evidence that could be used to blackmail a billionaire. The person knows that it is illegal and immoral to use and does not use it, but if they wanted to, it would be easy to sell to a criminal buyer at say, $100,000. If that evidence were destroyed in a natural disaster, could the loss of this valuable-if-used-illegally evidence be used as a tax write-off in their US federal taxes? Assume that the situation is otherwise such that a tax write-off would be possible, like that it was a declared federal disaster and so was not suspended in the 2018 tax reform.</p>
<p>In general, is there any legal use for the value of an object which is derived purely from a potential illegal use (that is never acted upon)? I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_of_illegal_income_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow noreferrer">have read that</a> illegally obtained income should be reported to federal taxes and that even expenses operating illegal businesses can be deducted. While those are related situations, they both require actually having committed a crime. In this case, I am considering whether there is a hypothetical where no crime is ever committed but someone legally obtains value from a potential illegal action. I would be interested in examples outside of tax write-offs if they exist, it's merely the only potential example I can think of.</p>

      <TITLE>Using software api documentation without copyright infringement</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I've been starting to worry about the details of software copyright. This brought up the question whether using source code from an official documentation, that is copyrighted as usual, is actually legal?

Yet the publishers of those API documentations do not put the how-to examples in public domain.</p>

<p>More specifically, suppose everything in this blog post is accurate, but kind of difficult to prove. Experts are needed to determine the truth, and the experts are, say, 9:1 in favor vs against it being true.</p>

      <TITLE>Enforcing the GPL license on software</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I published a software project under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0. I have written the code behind it, hence I am the copyright holder.</p>
<p>According to the AGPL license, anyone who redistributes this software or a derivative must distribute it under the GPL as well.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a distribution of a modified version of my software distributed under another license, and also violating other terms of the AGPL v3.0.</p>
<p>I have contacted several organisations, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Free Software Foundation (FSF)</li>
<li>gpl-violations.org</li>
</ul>
<p>but I did not receive any response.</p>
<p>I do not have adequate (financial) resources (and time) to hire a lawyer just to settle this small issue, especially as this is just a side project of mine.</p>
<p>How do I enforce the license of my AGPL software, and take action on the violators of the license(to comply with the AGPL)? There are a lot of information on the Internet on how to use the (A)GPL on your software but very few sources of information on how you can enforce it when someone violates the license.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

      <TITLE>Are the people who sell pre-owned copyrighted media on sites such as Amazon breaking a law?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Say you buy a pre-owned (second-hand) copy of a movie on a website like, say, Amazon.</p>

<p>AFAIK, no one who made the film or distributed it will ever see the color of your money, therefore, the prejudice and losses are comparable, if not worse (because they are a much larger scale system) to piracy.
But Amazon, on the other hand, will make a profit.</p>

<p>Now, when you bought it brand new, there might even have been a message telling you to not resell it on the box or as a roll-up before the film. I understand that you shouldn't be able to resell, and that the user who would buy it would have to buy it new, which would make the distributors and the rights holders make profit (not sure what you should do with your copy though, trash it?).</p>

<p>And yet thousands of dollars (probably more) are made everyday by people and by amazon through the sale of second hand media (also books, audio tapes, etc). 
(And sometimes second-hand media sells for as little as 1 cent of a dollar on sites like these, which makes its price value even smaller for the sellers and the website, and the price difference for the buyer versus "buying new" impossible to fight.)</p>

<p>Yet, no one talks about this when people mention online piracy and circulation of copyrighted media that doesn't profit the copyright holders.</p>

<p>So, is there an understanding between Amazon and copyright holders that no one is aware of?
Are second-hand physical goods not concerned by copyright laws?
Is it impossible to enforce, and on what grounds? (every transaction has been recorded on a server and includes people's addresses, etc).
Or is Amazon (and the likes, such as eBay, etc) such a giant and powerful company, that big media companies find it easier to target piracy websites "first" than these kinds of distribution websites?</p>

d. For the purposes of this Section 4, businesses that are deemed to
compete with [Acme Corp] include, without limitation, businesses engaged in IT

e. [Acme Corp] and Contractor agree that: this provision does not impose an undue
hardship on Contractor and is not injurious to the public; that this provision
is necessary to protect the business of [Acme Corp] and its affiliates, including
their trade secrets; the nature of Contractor's responsibilities with [Acme Corp]
under this Agreement require Contractor to have access to and develop

      <TITLE>Why does LP(MP)A 1989, s 2 proffer a 2nd form — that allows each of the 2 separate documents signed by merely 1 party? Advantages over 1st form?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I start by citing the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">s 2(3)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) The document incorporating the terms or, where contracts are exchanged, one of the documents incorporating them (but not necessarily the same one) must be signed by or on behalf of each party to the contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oxford University Prof. of English Law, <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/people/ben-mcfarlane" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ben McFarlane</a>, expounds this far more understandably.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4.6 The requirements for a valid contract for the sale or other disposition of an interest in
land are provided by section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
1989 (LP(MP)A 1989). Under that section, for a contract for sale of land to be valid
it must:</p>
<p>• be in writing;<br />
• incorporate all the terms the parties have expressly agreed (by setting out the
terms or by reference to another document) either:<br />
– <code>in a single document signed by both parties</code>; or<br />
– <em><strong>in each of two documents signed by one of the parties and exchanged.</strong></em><sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under s 2, the written contract may take one of two forms: <code>a single document signed by both parties</code>;
or <em><strong>separate documents each signed by one of the parties and exchanged</strong></em>. The document—or each
document, in the case of an exchange—must contain all of the terms expressly agreed by the parties.
The terms may be contained in the signed document—or documents, in the case of exchange—or be
contained in a separate document that is incorporated by reference.<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have spoken to my friends and family. Everyone I know has heard of, and dealt with, merely the first form — that I highlighted in <code>gray</code>. Nobody I know ever dealt with the second form — that I bolded and italicized.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Why didn't s 2 stick to the 1st form in gray? Why proffer the 2nd form?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the 2nd form's advantages? What can the 2nd form accomplish that the 1st form cannot?</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the 2nd form, why didn't s 2 require everyone to sign both separate documents? This feels safer, more conclusive, steadfast than merely 1 signature on each of the 2 documents.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm not sure if I should become a sole trader or create a business. I know the pros and cons of both of them, and the extra commitment is a bit of a turn off when it comes to creating a business. On the other side I'm also scared of getting sued so I want to protect myself as much as possible. Which option do people typically choose for the type of work I'm trying to do? I'm not sure if I'm over thinking the possibility of getting sued and I should just save myself time and effort and go the sole trader path, or if this fear is genuine in this line of business and I should put the time and effort into protecting myself as much as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If I was to become a sole trader am I allowed to create a company alias to make it look more professional? So on the website I could say "Created by so and so studios" rather than "Created by insert name"? Even though technically the "so and so studios" doesn't exist.</p></li>

      <TITLE>Reproducing game art in various forms for personal use and/or selling to friends</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>In various nerdy gaming communities, it's common for folks to produce higher quality tokens, play mats, and such containing artwork from the games. And some people will sell some of their works to basically pay for their hobby.</p>

<p>Question 1: If someone digitally copies an image and prints it on a play mat without permission that's obviously not legal for them to sell, but is it legal for personal use under Fair Use?</p>

<p>Question 2: Would it be illegal to use symbols from the game on tokens you create and sell? See links for an example of what I mean. The first link is actual card board images from the game. The second is the higher quality tokens someone produced. The reproduced drawings are ever so slightly different. What if they were identical? Does that matter? Or how different would they need to be?</p>

      <TITLE>If a pardon is specifically referencing a crime a person has been convicted of, can an individual sue him for a different crime?</TITLE>
      <BODY><blockquote>
<p>Pardons, except for amnesties, are typically given after a person has
been convicted of a crime, and they specifically reference that crime.
In this respect, President Trump’s pardons of Scooter Libby, Paul
Manafort, George Papadopoulos and Roger Stone are typical. After
asserting that the recipient is given a “Full and Unconditional
Pardon,” they go on to specify the statutes each was charged with
violating and describe in detail the punishments given. Their pardons
extend to the named crimes and no other. The pardon given to Michael
Flynn is somewhat different. After referencing the charge of lying to
federal investigators for which Flynn was convicted, the president
goes on to pardon Flynn not just for this crime but also for “any and
all possible offenses” within the jurisdiction of the Special
Counsel’s investigating authority or relating in any manner to the
Special Counsel’s investigation [of Russia’s attempted interference in
the 2016 presidential election and links to the Trump campaign].</p>

<p>If a pardon is specifically referencing a crime a person has been convicted of, can an individual or a government sue the pardoned person for a different crime committed at the same time? Let's say a person committed crime A, B, C and D, but he was only convicted for crime A and B, then after a pardon was handed, can people still sue that person for crime C and D even though the crimes were committed by the same act? It seems like it's the case since Michael Flynn's pardon was particularly architectured in a way to avoid this.</p>

<p>I understand why a prosecutor would accept a plea deal for a lesser crime in place of slogging through a trial for a chance of a conviction on a greater crime, but I do not understand why the prosecutor would want to accept such a plea deal after already having scored the conviction of the greater crime. I find it hard to believe that a state prosecutor would particularly care whether the body could be found or not after the associated conviction and already been scored.</p>

      <BODY><p>I've posted a question that had some legal repercussions in workplace.stackexchange.com, which is off-topic over there, so I'm asking the legal part of it here.</p>

<p>The situation is this. I'm a (inexperienced) system's administrator. I've been approached by my boss about his suspicions that an employee is playing video games at work. I've also been approached by the employee's coworker, who reported seeing weird flashes from his monitor, and that when someone gets close he switches to work related windows. That coworker was motivated to talk to me because he's overburden with work while his co-worker is lagging behind.</p>

<p>One day, after hours, his boss was snooping around on the employee's pc and asked me for help. We found Diablo 3 installed in the pc, and browser history containing some dating websites. Following these findings, the boss asked me to monitor his computer to get concrete data on those activities.</p>

<p>I can do that from a technical perspective, but I worry that doing so without his knowledge might be legally problematic, especially with the dating sites involved, it's possible I may come across very sensitive information.</p>

      <ID>30889</ID>
      <TITLE>Are there legal labelling requirements regarding the “moisture-wicking” property claimed for certain fabrics?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Or can I just claim that any fabric is moisture-wicking? Could I sell a garment advertising that it wicks moisture into outer-space, using technology developed by astronauts? While protecting the wearer from plagues and earthquakes? And neutralizing armpit odor using anti-rot nano-particles?</p>

<p>In the US? Worldwide?</p>

<p>I was going to ask this on Skeptics and I'm still not sure where it belongs.</p>

<p>I'm wondering why sports and outdoor equipment stores sell garments that advertise themselves as "moisture-wicking" when clearly they are made of wool or some synthetic material which, as far as I understand it, is less absorbent and therefore less liable to act like a "wick" via capillary action, than cotton, which is often a cheaper low-tech alternative. Seemingly this advertising myth has become quite entrenched in popular culture, I hear it cited by people all the time.</p>

<p>On the face of it these claims are literally true, in that all fabrics absorb moisture to some extent. However, there seems to be an implication that a fabric advertised as "moisture-wicking" will have a superior "wicking" ability to a cheaper and older "standard" fabric technology like cotton, and sometimes this superiority is an explicit part of the advertising on the label. Also, many such garments additionally claim to "wick moisture away from the skin" which would seem to imply some kind of violation of the second law of thermodynamics or conservation of energy, or at least to contradict the plain observation that the fabric is the same on the inside and outside and contains no directional asymmetry.</p>

<p>Are these claims governed by law? Do manufacturers only refrain from making more outlandish claims, like the examples I gave above, because then people would stop being so gullible? When does the FDA step in, for example if the purpose of having a "moisture-wicking" garment is to protect the wearer from catching a cold after exercise, could this claim be part of the labeling?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>equal protection law—as established by the U.S. Constitution’s
  Fourteenth Amendment—prohibits government agents from acting with
  “discriminatory purpose” (Washington v. Davis, 1976). It bars policies
  undertaken with <strong>animus</strong> (i.e., it bars a form of taste-based
  discrimination, since <strong>acting with animus</strong> typically means sacrificing
  utility)</p>

  <p>under the statutory disparate impact standard, a practice may be
  deemed discriminatory if it has an unjustified adverse effect on

      <TITLE>What does it mean to grant rescission on terms?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Kindly see the embolded phrase below.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>18.5 Remedy</h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no tort of undue influence. As a result, C cannot recover damages from D if a claim
in undue influence is successful. This is sometimes criticised, and it may be that in time
undue influence will evolve to be recognised as a wrong which triggers compensation.<sup>45</sup>
After all, in <em>Libya Investment Authority v Goldman Sachs International</em>, Rose J recognised
that the stronger party owes certain duties to the weaker party in a relationship of influence.
A breach of duty is a wrong, and the normal response to a civil wrong is damages.<br />
      Nevertheless, the traditional and orthodox view is that the only remedy for undue influence
is rescission.<sup>46</sup> It is worth highlighting that the usual bars of rescission apply.<sup>47</sup> So, for
example, in <em>Allcard v Skinner</em>, the claim for undue influence was barred because of the claimant’s
delay in bringing her claim (laches). Similarly, in the three-party scenarios discussed
in Chapter 18.4, if the bank is not put on inquiry and purchases its rights in good faith
without notice of the undue influence, C will not be able to rescind the transaction since that
would unfairly prejudice the bank. But if the bank is put on inquiry, then it will have notice
of the undue influence, and as a result the rights it acquires will not be sufficient to prevent rescission unless that bank has taken reasonable steps to ensure that C has not entered into
the transaction as a result of undue influence. In <em>Etridge</em>, Lord Scott said:<sup>48</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If contractual consent has been procured by undue influence or misrepresentation for which a
party to the contract is responsible, the other party, the victim, is entitled, subject to the usual
defences of change of position, affirmation, delay etc, to avoid the contract.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been cases where <strong>rescission has been shown to be a flexible remedy that has been
granted on terms.</strong><sup>49</sup> For example, in <em>Cheese v Thomas</em>,<sup>50</sup> the agreement was between C, aged
85, and his great-nephew, D, to buy a house to live in together. They purchased a house for
£83,000; C contributed £43,000 in cash, and D contributed the rest of the money by way of
a mortgage. D defaulted on the mortgage payments, and the house was sold for £55,000.
The court held that the relationship between C and D was one of trust and confidence, and
that the transaction was manifestly disadvantageous to C, since he paid a substantial sum of
money for a ‘seriously insecure’ right that tied him to that particular house.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>45 See eg L Ho, ‘Undue Influence and Equitable Compensation’ in P Birks and F Rose (eds), <em>Restitution and
Equity</em> (Mansfield Press, 2000) vol 1. Similar arguments are often made in the context of duress, which is also not, in itself, a wrong that leads to damages.<br />
46 For general discussion of rescission, see Chapter 16.4.
47 See Chapter 16.4.4.<br />
48 <em>Etridge</em>, [144]. 49 Though partial rescission is impossible: see Chapter 16.4.4.1.

      <TITLE>Agreement on minimum global corporate income tax</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Today there are some headlines that G7 countries and a lot of others decided to go with a global minimum corporate income tax of 15% (for companies of a certain size only).</p>
<p>The way they want to execute it, as I understand it from the news, is that if e.g. a company moves its income to its subsidary located in a foreign low-tax country with e.g. 10%, then the country of the company head office can claim from the company the difference to the global minimum which would be e.g. 5% difference. A result would be extra tax income for the US from companies like Apple or Google which are located in Ireland which has a corporate income tax below 15%.</p>
<p>Now <strong>my question</strong>: Why does this require an international agreement?</p>
<p>The US (and other countries in favor of this setup) could make a national law just asking for the difference. Irelands agreement is not needed and not required at all. Furthermore, Irish companies can still go with their home country's low tax (well below the "global minimum") and would even gain a competetitive advantage.</p>

      <TITLE>Can parents be taxed for giving gifts to children?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Are there scenarios where parents would be taxed for giving gifts to their children, such as on birthdays, Christmas, etc.? Would gifts be subject to gift taxes if the amount exceeds $15,000/$30,000 (the current maximum that's subject to the annual exclusion for single parents and married parents, respectively)? Also, what about the kiddie tax? (I assume the kiddie tax applies just to monetary income, rather than physical gifts.)</p>
<p>For gift taxes, I've assumed that holiday-themed gifts to children wouldn't be the focus, but it appears children aren't exempt the way spouses are. Does this mean that to avoid gift taxes, parents must be careful not to exceed the amount covered by the annual exclusion for each child? And for the kiddie tax, would this mainly apply to things like an allowance, not one-time gifts?</p>

      <TITLE>How do US appellate courts know the facts of the case?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>My understanding is this: In the United States, in a jury trial the jury is the finder of fact, but they are not invited (or permitted) to share any of their findings beyond guilty/not guilty. I also know that a verdict of guilty can be appealed. Also, appellate courts aren't supposed to rule on questions of fact.</p>
<p>This, to me, looks like the court has no way of having any facts. So, what exactly do the appeals courts base their decisions on?</p>

      <TITLE>Does a tenancy swap reset the start of tenancy date</TITLE>
      <BODY><ul>
<li>A and B rented a house from private landlord L, on a 3 year term with an option to break with 2 months notice after 12 months.</li>
<li>After 16 months, B moved out.</li>
<li>A agreed with the landlord on a swap to add C on all the original terms including the same (now 20 months away) end date. The new tenancy agreement also notes that the tenants accept the inventory from A's original start date.</li>
<li>Circumstances changed such that both need to move city, timed such that A and C will both want to leave 10 months after the swap. They gave 3 months notice to this effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>The landlord's agents responded with the claim that because a new tenancy agreement was signed between A, C and L after the swap, they cannot break the tenancy until 12 months after the swap. This surprised C and astonished A, who will have been in the house for 26 months by that point. Both had understood a swap to imply that C would have effectively the same set of rights and obligations as B, had B continued in the tenancy and A would also continue as before.</p>

<p>Does such a change of tenant generally entail restarting the clock on contractual or statuatory obligations in an AST, and do A and C have any recourse other than paying off the last 2 months or negotiating fresh exit terms from a position of relative weakness?</p>

      <TITLE>What exactly is illegal about the Canadian trucking protests?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I have been following the coverage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Canada convoy protest</a> in the news, and particularly the invocation of the Emergencies Act by PM Trudeau. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mCEDdIEBDY" rel="nofollow noreferrer">In his announcement</a>, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're entering the third week of illegal blockades, that have been disrupting the lives of too many Canadians.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here in our capital city, families, small businesses have been enduring illegal obstruction of their neighbourhoods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is not alone in his position that the protests are illegal. Doug Ford called the protests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SpSHzipehM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"an illegal occupation"</a> last week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're now two weeks into the siege of Ottawa. I call it a siege because that's what it is: an illegal occupation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is: What's illegal about it? I can find lots of quotes from politicians <em>saying</em> that it's an illegal protest, but not much about exactly what laws are being broken. I'm not Canadian, and don't know exactly what sort of protests are protected under Canadian law. So I'd like to find out what's illegal in this case.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Some protesters have been found with illegal weapons</strong>. A war memorial was also desecrated, and other individual acts that are obviously illegal have been reported. I'm not aware that that makes the protest as a whole illegal (but I could be wrong).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The blockades are severely economically damaging.</strong> Again, to my knowledge, this does not by itself make a protest illegal.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The noise is disruptive to the local area.</strong> Does Canada have laws against noisy protests?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Local emergency powers make occupation of certain areas illegal.</strong> My interpretation of the above quotes is that the <em>justification</em> of the use of emergency powers is that the protests are <em>already</em> transparently illegal. Again, I could be mistaken.</p>

      <BODY><p>The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (in the UK) provides for 'fair dealing.' It allows for copies to be made of a copyright-protected work for the purpose of private study. I was wondering three things about fair dealing for the purpose of private study:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does fair dealing in this case include making modifications or adaptations of a work, or is it restricted to reproducing the work?</li>
<li>Do you have to provide acknowledgement for the source? I was considering this because the 'fair dealing' for research purposes required you to give an acknowledgement, but for private study this doesn't seem to be necessary, perhaps because the only person who'll view the product is you.</li>
<li>Are there any restrictions on 'fair dealing' for private study?</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is the relevant clause but you can also find the legislation here: <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III/crossheading/general#:%7E:text=Research%20and%20private%20study" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III/crossheading/general#:~:text=Research%20and%20private%20study</a>.</p>

      <TITLE>Am I allowed to intermediately rent my rooms for 2 months?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I live in Germany and rented two rooms in a residential community ("WG") for several years. Recently, someone moved in who behaves very badly. He destroyed many things, smokes inside, always listens to loud music, has loud fights with his girlfriend very frequently and at all times of the day (and night), is very aggressive, etc. The landlord terminated his contract after the tenant destroyed the entrance door and the same day terminated his contract immediately ("Außerordentliche Kündigung") after he physically attacked me. But by then I had already terminated my contract. It ends at the 30th of June.</p>

<p>I found a different place to live. Now I want to rent my two rooms to someone else for the remaining two months so I don't have to pay double (for my old place and for my new place).</p>

<p>I can't really find a next tenant because the landlord wants to renovate the place after I moved out. There is a 3rd tenant but he too terminated his contract (ending at the same day as mine). However, people are potentially interested in living there for 2 months. </p>

<p>I asked him whether I am allowed to rent my rooms to someone else for those two months but he declined. He also does not want to let me stop paying rent earlier.</p>

<p>I read that you can rent your rooms to someone else because the landlord basically always has to allow it. But I'm not sure. </p>

<p>Is there a way for me to get what I want? </p>

      <TITLE>Misrepresented Land Sale in Arkansas</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>They realtor selling land in Arkansas listed a 10 acre tract for sale with pictures of the property, and specific information, such as "at the corner of county road "blank" and highway "blank" with county and state road access", and "mature pine plantation ready for immediate income opportunities", as the pines were at maturity. We went under contract for the land. It was a cash transaction. The survey took 2 months to complete, as the seller couldn't find anyone to survey the property. Our realtor found a surveyor, although the seller (a timber company) paid for it. We have spent months improving the land with fencing, brush hogging, adding a culvert, etc. The property was flagged, but we thought we received a terrible survey crew. It turned out those flags were the starting points to survey our "actual" land. 6 months post sale, a timber company contacts us, and notifies us that we have a gate on their land.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>County Assessor had the parcels flipped on their mapping of the 10 acre property we thought we bought and the 10 acre property North of us (that legally we actually bought)
1.a. The same timber company that notified us that we were on their land were trying to sell
our actually owned land for 3 months, as the parcels were flipped.</li>
<li>We purchased based on all of the incorrect pictures the realtor posted and the precise comments of "mature pine ready for immediate income", "county and state road access", and multiple home sites to build on". The actual land has almost no pine trees, is not ready for immediate income, and the terrain in so awful that there are no places to legitimately build a home on or even get to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do we have any recourse? If so, would it be against the timber company seller or the timber seller's agent? It's our first land purchase. We know better for next time. For the record, the survey ended up being done on the "correct" property, although the property we thought we purchased mimics the 10 acre square layout of the property we found out we actually purchased.</p>

      <TITLE>Could it make sense to add a non-used reason for firing someone in court?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Lets imagine there is a person called George that works for the dutch government to secure their ICT systems. The government body he worked for was not a secret agency or something like that. This George does this work for over <em>8</em> years. About <em>5</em> years ago, he made some sort of more or less innocent computer virus, that he might also spread.</p>
<p>This was all done during a holiday in another country. Now by some reason (unrelated to this computer virus or some similar event) he is fired by his boss. George became emotional, goes to a bar and drank too much alcohol. He became drunk and told someone in the bar that he got fired, while he actually has made (and possibly spread) a computer virus, which is <em>(in this scenario, but probably also in reality)</em> against his work-contract. However no one ever came to knew that. He became so mad, or emotional that he started to write that fact(the virus) as a small blogpost on his blog.</p>
<p>Now lets imagine that due to circumstances that next morning he more or less forgot about his blogpost(<strong>at least until the court meeting</strong>). His former employer, however came to know this post because he either likes reading that blog, or there was talked about in his government body.</p>
<p>George went to court because he finds his situation unfair(which it might or not might be). To him, he just wants to continue his job, so that is what his charge is about.</p>
<p>Now let's assume that his former employer knows about the post before he goes to the court-house. They all have to appear in court together. Would it make sense for George's boss to just talk about this blogpost, or not for he was fired for another reason? If this is the case, what are the most reasonable reasons not to disclose (the fact that he made a virus) to the judges?</p>
<p>This virus that George has made/spread had have was not targeted against nor had real big impact on his or other dutch government computer systems.</p>

      <BODY><p>Recently a high shool friend of mine got nailed with a $450 speeding ticket on a back country road. He'll also have to get pay for the class to get 3 (not sure, might be 4) which is 4 hours on two Saturdays. Overall, with insurance price increasing, his little ticket will probably cost around $1,200 total.
Now when he got the ticket the cop was going a fair speed (40ish) in the other direction (2 lane road). Physically the rate of change of speeds between them is greatly increased as the cop was going the other direction. My friend believes he was going less than the cop said, and his younger brother was watching he speedometer and said the same.
Are the circumstances of him being pulled grounds to fight the ticket (with a decent chance of winning)? Can regular radar guns that a cop might use account for the difference in the rate of chamge of speed? The cop said he was going 32 over and that just sounds plain wrong. Thanks in advance.</p>

      <BODY><p>Several months ago I signed a contract to lease an apartment in Utah, USA and took up residence in the said apartment. The contract was stated explicitly to run through August 25th. This is clearly and unambiguously stated in writing.</p>

<p>I signed this contract and so did the landlords.</p>

<p>However, now the landlord is telling me that this was a typo and that it should have said August 14th. I was notified of this on August 6. They are threatening to fine me or send collections after me if I do not vacate the apartment by noon on the 14th of August.</p>

<p>The only problem is that I have employment in this city until August 19th. I would need to live in my car for five days if they kick me out.</p>

<p>I am not overly concerned about them coming after me, as I do not believe that the case law backs them up here. However, I felt it best to get the legal opinion of the Internet on the matter. </p>

      <TITLE>consumer demand for arbitration with AAA: what are the first steps when fee paid by business?</TITLE>
      <BODY><h3>Quick summary</h3>

<p>How does a consumer file a demand for arbitration to AAA, when the fee is covered by the business?</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Some terms of use for business services impose to the consumer the use of arbitration instead of courts, yet the business pays the fees for arbitration. This is the case for example with Uber (<a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/terms/us/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.uber.com/legal/terms/us/</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and
  arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However,
  if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, <strong>Uber will pay all
  such fees</strong>, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of
  your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was
  frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <em>Consumer Demand for Arbitration</em> Form can be obtained from AAA: <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Link">Consumer Demand for Arbitration Form</a>. The <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">manual</a> states that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The filing fee must be paid before a matter is considered properly
  filed . If the court order directs that a specific party is
  responsible for the filing fee, it is the responsibility of the filing
  party either to make such payment to the AAA and seek reimbursement as
  directed in the court order or to make other such arrangements so that
  the filing fee is submitted to the AAA with the Demand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The question</h3>

<p>What does this  mean in practice, it seems there are two options? Does it mean the consumer should pay the fee, and will somehow be reimbursed at some point? Or does the consumer has the choice to go for the second option (cf <em>either</em>), and ask the business to pay directly the fee? Finally, what is a <em>frivolous</em> claim or relief? Could a dispute over a small amount be considered frivolous?</p>

      <BODY><p>I belong to a New Jersey HOA of about 300 homeowners. Our board decided to obtain a $500,000 bank loan. It's been spending money like water and used up all the money that was designated for major repair work that was needed. Now, it has decided to take out a loan to do that work and any other things that it may think of.
Is this legal. Aren't there some kind of requirements for doing this?

I went to their public group chat room on the app and asked users questions on how that app could be improved. I got various feedback about how they should have a 'like' button, GIF, threading, and etc. I decided to add a like button and comment section for social posting. I asked questions to users several times for two weeks. Then the developer of the app intervened and asked me not to do that. Even though the feedback was given in the public chat room and feedback was a good idea but not a game-changer, could this be an example of misappropriation due to the fact the info was obtained from their app? Could the developer also accuse me of unfair competition to Apple?</p>

      <TITLE>Is there a difference in a lawyer's liability for "passive" versus "active"negligence?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>For instance, "passive" negligence might be, "I didn't do A (required by the law or the code of legal ethics) because I genuinely didn't know that A needed to be done" (even though I should have). "Active" negligence would be, "I knew I was supposed to do A, but didn't do it because it would cost money."</p>

<p>Another example: The client wants "X" included in a deal and the lawyer didn't include it. Lawyer 1 says, "I didn't know that the client wanted X in the deal because i never received a phone call or email to that effect. (This is conspicuously <em>absent</em> from both lawyer and client emails.) Lawyer 2 says, "I knew that X was a priority for the client (and was legal, even "standard" practice), but I failed to include/downplayed it because I had other priorities."</p>

<p>For example, consider "You may not say including but not limited to the words 'cat', 'dog', and 'human'". In this case, it is explicitly stated that if I said cat, dog, or human, I'd be in breach of this contract. However, since there is "including but not limited to", let's say I said "fish". If the party that created the agreement didn't like that I said fish, could they sue me for breach of contract as they never specified what words I could say?</p>

The agreement requires the vendor provide a breakdown of prepaid amounts on settlement by a given time (say 12pm) so the purchase price can be adjusted.   The purchaser is then required to settle by a given time (say end of the day).     </p>

<p>There is nothing in the agreement that specifically contemplates how breaches are to be addressed.   There is nothing specifically stating that payment is contingent on receipt of the information required to the adjustment.</p>

<p>Preparation of the adjustment document reveal that key representations made by the seller (and stated as being key representations) were substantially incorrect.</p>

<p>It is accepted that the seller has breached the agreement in at least 2 ways - They did not provide a settlement document on time, and they made a material misrepresentation.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>(Absent any clauses in the agreement speaking to how conflicts are resolved) -</p>

<p>Does a material breach of the agreement by the vendor allow the purchaser to withhold payment and/or void the agreement?</p>

<p>If the vendor subsequently supplies a correct adjustment (which reflects turnover less then represented and relied on by the purchaser) is the purchaser obligated to settle, even though the vendor is in breach of the agreement?</p>

<p>However, I am highly concerned with the effects of the deal, as I found out from my friends. Reading the <a href="https://policy.naver.com/policy/service_en.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Naver terms of service</a>, it seems that when the sale goes through, Naver will now own all user content. Once you delete your content, Wattpad no longer retains it. it is gone permanently, or so I think.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have already done it, and fear that I will have to delete all of my content so Naver cannot own it. How will it affect the copyright of user-made content? We already suspect that Naver is probably probing the site, and maybe even cataloging it for "data collection.
Also, when exactly is the "second quarter of Wattpad’s fiscal year."?</p>

      <TITLE>Is 'reading down' clause optional?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Specifically with regard to a UK/England employment contract. I am used to seeing clauses in contracts which state crudely that if one clause is found unreasonable, that clause alone will be struck out and the remainder of the contract left to stand. From <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/q/9532/10852">this question</a>, I gather this is termed a 'reading down' clause. From comments, it can also be a <a href="https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/salvatorian-clause" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Salvatorian Clause</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severability" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Severability Clause</a>.</p>

<p>Is this form strictly necessary (i.e. one unreasonable clause in a contract has significant risk to invalidate the whole), or is it simply additional security in capturing something which would typically occur regardless?</p>

      <TITLE>Under these circumstances, can a company be sued for the actions of an employee?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I should clarify a little bit: assuming that 1) the employee went against company policy and did something illegal at work,2) the company was alerted to these actions (though the employee was unable to be identified at the time) through official channels and, 3) those channels chose to ignore rather than investigate the matter, 4) the illegal actions were felonies and rather egregious, and 5) the employee was caught on camera elsewhere perpetuating the felony multiple times. </p>

<p>Under these circumstances, would the employer be liable to be sued? If so, would it be reasonable to assume that it would be unlikely to be thrown out? I had assumed some sort of negligence might be reasonable. </p>

<p>This is in the US. </p>

<p>Edit to address questions in the comments: this was a theft, performed during work hours while on duty. The employer did not directly benefit from the theft. </p>

      <BODY><p>Seeing so much news about blockchains and banks I have a question that I may need your help.</p>

<p>Taking in consideration the Bank Secrecy Act, can a Bank use a completely Encrypted Ledger? KYC is still required, deposits and withdraws will still be reported if one deposits/withdraws more than $10k. But the bank has no idea about users' balances or their transactions. So, the bank uses an encrypted ledger that doesn't have a key to be decrypted. Namely, the ledger is encrypted in a way in which transactions are encrypted and unlinkable. Only the users can decrypt their balances and spend their funds with a... hardware token. Using this hardware tokens users can give a proof to the bank that the balance was right. Something like how is done in blockchains solutions focused on privacy. </p>

<p>Can public/private banks in the future use encrypted Ledgers? 
If yes why banks didn't do it until now. 
If no, why banks can't use encrypted Ledgers?</p>

<p>Case in point - the impeachment of Trump by the House of Reps. Pelosi is saying she won't send articles of impeachment to the Senate until she can be convinced that there will be a fair trial. </p>

<p>BUT - in the trial, she and company will be prosecutors. The defendant will be Trump. Is it Trump's constitutional right to demand fairness or the right of those who want to prosecute him?</p>

      <TITLE>Does marriage ordinance contradict with basic law?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><em>I am new to this stackexchange and the field of law, so please kindly point out what I am wrong, and what should be corrected! :)</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Here are some background information I should list out, which I have serious doubt on.</p>

<p>Base on the "Sino-British Joint Declaration", the [Basic Law][1] is, and should be treated as a constitution for Hong Kong Special Administration Region. For the law itself, in Article 25 it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Article 25</strong><br>
  All Hong Kong residents shall be equal before the law. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in Article 37 it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Article 37</strong><br>
  The freedom of marriage of Hong Kong residents and their right to raise a family freely shall be protected by law. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for [the Ordinance of marriages in Hong Kong][2]:</p>

<p>According to the Ordinance(Cap 181) s40, it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Every marriage under this Ordinance shall be a Christian marriage
  or the civil equivalent of a Christian marriage.  </p>
  
  <p>(2) The expression "Christian marriage or the civil equivalent of a Christian marriage" implies <strong>a formal ceremony recognized by the law as involving the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case "Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice", we learnt that the case influenced the explanation of "[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance][3]" s1 and s22, which includes the category of sexual orientation.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Therefore my question would be</strong>: To the extend of freedom of marriage, and the right to raise a family freely, isn't the Marriage Ordinance is exact the opposite, which restricts the freedom of will that one would want same sex marriage? </p>

<p>Would the freedom of marriage includes same sex couples? </p>

<p>And will it become unconstitutional to the Ordinance itself, because of the allowance to one man and one woman?</p>

So, if you apply rules in school, condominium... although they tend to mirror the "Rights" that you have, they are more about local rules and the responsibilities related to those rules.</p>

<p>So, since I'm not North American but I follow some of those discussions especially in the political context, I tend to favor the short straight answer some people would throw right in the beginning of the discussion:
"There is nothing in the Bill saying 'Freedom of speech as long you behave responsibly'".</p>

<p>So, in terms of law, how would that proceed? Is there implicit or explicit ways to relate Responsibilities to Rights?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prohibited subsidies: subsidies that require recipients to meet
certain export targets, or to use domestic goods instead of imported
goods. They are prohibited because they are specifically designed to
distort international trade, and are therefore likely to hurt other
countries’ trade. They can be challenged in the WTO dispute settlement
procedure where they are handled under an accelerated timetable. If
the dispute settlement procedure confirms that the subsidy is
prohibited, it must be withdrawn immediately. Otherwise, the
complaining country can take counter measures. If domestic producers
are hurt by imports of subsidized products, countervailing duty can be
imposed.</p>
<p>Actionable subsidies: in this category the complaining country has to
show that the subsidy has an adverse effect on its interests.
Otherwise the subsidy is permitted. The agreement defines three types
of damage they can cause. One country’s subsidies can hurt a domestic
industry in an importing country. They can hurt rival exporters from
another country when the two compete in third markets. And domestic
subsidies in one country can hurt exporters trying to compete in the
subsidizing country’s domestic market. If the Dispute Settlement Body
rules that the subsidy does have an adverse effect, the subsidy must
be withdrawn or its adverse effect must be removed. Again, if domestic
producers are hurt by imports of subsidized products, countervailing
duty can be imposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the WTO, research subsidies don't see to be considered to be illegal subsidies since their impact are not directly measurable and only has an impact much further down the road. Am I mistaken? I am not 100% sure.</p>

      <TITLE>Sharing a negative experience using websites with the name of the business/individual who caused it</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Imagine this hypothetical situation:</p>

<p>My parents have been trying to build a new home for some time and around 2016 they got involved with an architect/builder (let's call him Fred Fraud) who at the time was also the local distributor for a large American company (let's call them Buildeeblox) who manufacture a type of building product which is still relatively new in the UK.</p>

<p>Having designed our new home (pro bono) Fred then invoiced my parents in July last year and they paid him over £50k for the building materials so they would arrive well in advance of work being able to commence.</p>

<p>A year later it would appear the reason this architect has been deliberately dragging out and delaying our project as much as possible is that he doesn't have the materials that we paid for and is now ignoring all communication. Buildeeblox has since cut all business ties with Fred and are effectively washing their hands of him saying that we are on our own as their distributors are all independent parties. </p>

<p>So, aside from doing the expected things such as preparing a court case (which may be a pointless exercise as we paid our monies to Fred's ltd company which doesn't have much in the way of assets) and speaking to ActionFraud, I intend to document this entire sorry saga online and get it as wide an audience as possible, A) as a naming and shaming exercise, and B) for the benefit of anyone else who may end up giving these people money.</p>

<p>I haven't approached any newspapers just yet but will do when I know what direction this ends up going. I have also scraped Fred's twitter contacts, Facebook friends and both parties LinkedIn groups so I can spam them later.</p>

<p>I was planning to buy the following domains (again, these are aliases);</p>

<ul>

<li><p>How can the contract between O and R  be oral??? How's this question "deliberately ambiguous on whether the contract is oral or written"? Even if O and R negotiated the sale orally, R signed a 'written "Sale Note"'!</p>
</li>
<li><p>The textbook's answer doesn't bring up the Parol Evidence Rule, but can O plead the Parol Evidence Rule to prove that the contract is written, not oral?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the problem question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O (original owner) specialises in selling clothes. O has a retail outlet in Bond Street and sells online.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>R (rogue) wants to buy a tie for £15. R says he is David Beckham, the famous footballer, whom O knows by name but has never seen. In fact R is impersonating Beckham. R offers O £10 for the tie, which O accepts. O then asks R to sign a written “Sale Note” (stating the price and various terms, including the fact the goods are non-returnable) which R does in the name of Beckham. O, knowing of Beckham’s reputation, agrees to take a cheque which is subsequently dishonoured, so that O is never paid. R sells the tie to BFP for £5. O discovers this when BFP advertises the tie on eBay. O demands that BFP return the tie to O, but BFP refuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Advise BFP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the relevant part of my textbook's answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue here is unilateral mistake as to identity. The question is deliberately ambiguous on whether the contract is oral or written. You can argue either way, but must apply appropriate law (<em>Lewis v Averay</em> in the case of an oral contract and <em>Shogun Finance v Hudson</em> in the case of a written contract). The result of the litigation O v. BFP depends on whether the contract is characterized as written or oral.</p>

      <TITLE>Does Unsecured Debt Have Implicit Collateral?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I am thinking of a simple case.</p>
<p>For example, suppose I bought a home, but there is a mortgage where the contract stipulates that if I default, the bank can seize up to 95% of the home value. This 95% is a hypothetical situation, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>I also have a credit card debt.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If I default on both obligations and have access to 5% of the home value, does the credit card company collect debt through this unencumbered portion (i.e. 5%)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If this is the case, isn't it reasonable to say that unsecured debts have implicit collateral? In the hypothetical example, even though my credit card debt is considered "unsecured" debt, because the credit card company can come after my unencumbered portion (i.e. 5%, the part of my asset that is not collateralized to secured-debt creditors), in effect, the unsecured-debt creditors do have collateral as well?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I ask this, because I think of unsecured debt as something without a collateral. But, in reality, the unsecured-debt creditors can come after any unencumbered asset that does not have senior creditor's priority claim (e.g. usually secured-debt creditors). So, one could think of unsecured debts also have implicit collateral?</p>

      <TITLE>Can I use freely information from personal emails and some personal answers</TITLE>
      <BODY><p><strong>Background story:</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Recently I've written some <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27391/question-about-using-wikipedia-content-about-cc-by-sa-license-about-its-cop">questions</a> on law.stackexchange. People wrote answers to those questions, and also wrote some comments. I read these things and got some new thoughts from them. I'll refer to these as <em>stack_thoughts</em>. This is the <strong>first source</strong> of some new thoughts about my question.</p></li>
<li><p>Also I wrote partly similar question to some other places through email, and received responses. I read those responses and got ideas which I'll refer to as <em>email_thoughts</em>. This is the <strong>second source</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>I also asked some questions on a talk page in my profile in Wikipedia. There, one can ask for some help, which I did. And I also received answers, from which I got <em>wiki_personal_thoughts</em>. This is the <strong>Third source</strong>.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>To normally prolong my working on <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27391/question-about-using-wikipedia-content-about-cc-by-sa-license-about-its-cop">this same problem</a>, I need to collect, join, analyze, and use thoughts from all three sources. I need to have possibility, to "formulate" this all thoughts, in all mentioned places. I can do this, in particular by two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>First. I can just blindly use them, write about them without mention of the sources where I got them.  </li>
<li>Second. Before use all these thoughts I can ask for permission from the authors that are my sources. E.g. I can write a message, to each person who replied on my talk page in Wikipedia, about - can I use what they told me, in some other place, maybe on <em>stackexchange</em>. They might reply with a yes or a no.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So question is next:</strong><br>
How can I utilize normally, ethically, and legally information from these three resources (sources)?</p>

<p>I know that there a lot on the internet about using copyrighted text resources - but what about personal email letters, and personal messages?</p>

      <BODY><p>I am a 22-year-old male, and last fall, I found this girl in an online chat site. When I asked her age, she told me she was 19. We exchanged numbers and started texting a lot every day. I had started liking her, and I told her about my feelings. She said she needed time, but in February, she finally said that she was ready to be in a relationship with me. It has been about two months now.</p>

<p>This morning, I received a text from her number saying that the person is her mother and she is a "minor", and she will be pressing charges against me. I am very scared. I have all the evidence of the texts she sent me, but I am petrified. How do I handle this? </p>

      <TITLE>Why can't the Supreme court overturn Texas abortion law if abortion during the first semester is a constitutional right?</TITLE>
      <BODY><blockquote>
<p>Texas designed its law in a unique way to allow abortions to be banned
without a court intervening, by authorizing any private citizen to sue
doctors and clinics who perform abortions on women more than
approximately six weeks after a woman’s last period. The Texas law
also allows any private citizen to sue people who assist women in
obtaining an abortion after that time period.</p>

<p>A woman has a federal constitutional right to obtain an abortion during the first stage and the Texas law effectively prevents women from obtaining abortion as clinics will be unable to run the  financial and other risks that come from waiting for a private person to sue them under the Texas law depriving them from their constitutional rights.</p>

      <TITLE>Contract termination in distrokid -</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>It looks like from the big four (ditto, distrokid, tunecore and cdbaby) the only ones that do not want my rights forever (irrevocably) are distrokid and cdbaby (for more information have a look at my previous two questions) and I have two questions. In <a href="https://cdbaby.com/membercontract.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CD Baby</a> it is quite explicit, I have to send them an email containing specific information and they then send a "Takedown Notice" to the stores.</p>
<p>However in <a href="https://distrokid.com/agreement/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DistroKid</a> it is not.</p>
<p><em><strong>Termination</strong></em></p>
<p>there is this section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. The term of this Agreement and our Services hereunder (the “Term”)
will begin on the Effective Date and will continue for one (1) year,
unless renewed or terminated earlier.</p>
<p>b. The Term will renew automatically at the end of each annual
contract period (and your credit or debit card will be charged
accordingly) unless you terminate your account prior the end of the
then-current contract year via your account on the user dashboard in
the DistroKid site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should I read that as:</p>
<p>(1) "you commit to a year each time, but we can pull out any time" or</p>
<p>(2) "you commit to a year, but either of us can pull out any time".</p>
<p>In which case what is the point in specifying a year? so that it auto-expires?</p>
<p><em><strong>Notice to the stores</strong></em></p>
<p>In Distrokid there is section</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d. After the end of the Term, we will notify all applicable Digital
Stores to remove your Recordings and will have no further obligation
to you other than to account and pay for monies earned during the
Term. Customers who downloaded or otherwise accessed your Recordings
may be able to retain and continue listening to your Recordings even
after the Term of this Agreement is over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do they say "applicable"? Should I be worried that for some stores this is not applicable? There is no definition of what is applicable (otherwise it would be Applicable wouldn't it?).</p>
<p>I should add that distrokid is much cheaper than CD baby, that is the reason I don't just go with cd baby. also I need to read other parts of the contract and ask questions about those too.</p>

      <BODY><p>Imagine that the IRS is auditing somebody's tax return. The auditor thinks something is wrong with the return. However, he/she is not sure and does not have any hard facts on what is wrong. The auditor wants to read all the person's brokerage statements. However, he does not want to go to court to get a warrant to read them. Does the auditor need a warrant? Could the auditor just call up the brokerage firms and ask for the statements? Also as I understand it, the 1099s that the broker firm sends to the IRS has less information on it then the 1099s they send to the clients. Could the IRS get the client's version of the form without a warrant?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that under the US constitution the IRS would need a warrant.</p>

      <TITLE>How far does the derivative work copyright go for 3D printed objects?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Though similar questions have been asked before, I could not find one that answers this exact premise.</p>

<p>Say, there is a 3D printable file distributed under e.g. the CC BY-NC 4.0 license. This license has a non-commercial clause.</p>

<p>Another question (<a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7336/does-a-3d-print-of-a-cad-file-constitute-a-derivative-work">Does a 3D print of a CAD file constitute a derivative work?</a>) already confirms that prints of 3D models are a derivative work of the file and thus still fall under the original license.</p>

<p>This would mean, one could not sell a print of a thus protected file.</p>

<p>But how does that relate to the First Sale Doctrine? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine</a>)</p>

<p>The First Sale Doctrine says, that the copyright owner's exclusive right to distribute a particular copy ends once they make it's first sale. So e.g. a copyright owner cannot stop a buyer of a book of theirs from reselling this particular copy of the book, while still retaining the right to stop the buyer from copying the book.</p>

<p>Now, one could argue that distributing the file and allowing others to make physical copies from that file would be similar to a first sale and thus allow the owner of the physical copy of the object to resell it.</p>

<p>If that's not the case, what else can the copyright owner restrict the license taker restrict from doing? Would it be possible to restrict the license taker to only print the file e.g. using a specific brand of filament? Can the copyright owner dictate terms of use for 3D printed objects derived from their file?</p>

<ol>
<li>A has made the flute</li>
<li>B is simply very poor and has no other
toys to play.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, who will get the possession of the flute - A or B?</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">John Locke</a>, in his 2 Treatise of Government has written the <em>one who has created the thing will own that thing</em>. However, he has also said that <em>"one can only take as much possession of property as would ensure that everyone else also has enough common property"</em></p>
<p>Though I believe that A should get the flute because he has created it. However, considering the land re-distribution in India, the second one is also right.</p>
<p>Hence, who should get the flute?</p>

<p>If they terminate the interview at that point I will then sue them for discrimination based on my political beliefs, which is illegal in my state (california).</p>

<p>Rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>I know that recording a private conversation is illegal and won't be admitted in court, but I plan to get around that by doing this in a public area of their business where other people are around.  This will also help keep me from being physically assaulted by stating my belief.</p>

<p>Can this tactic of inciting a strong emotional reaction that betrays someone into admitting an illegal discrimination be used to destroy veteran businesses?</p>

      <BODY><p>From <a href="https://www.guardianbooth.com/security-guard-shot/amp/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, death rate of security guards is 1/1000 per year. Of the armed, professional guards its maybe 10x higher.</p>
<p>An average life insurance policy is $100 per month for a 30 year old, with a about a 0.001% monthly risk of death. That means, scaled for risk of death, a security guard would need 100x more or $10,000 a month life insurance. This is obviously far excess of their wage.</p>
<p>Since security guards are basically irrational and dont adequately value their lives, is it fraud for them to take out a life insurance policy? Not that they would, but if a security company took out policies for security guards would it basically either be impossible or a fraud conspiracy, given their risk of death is so under priced?</p>

      <TITLE>Cat Grooming Incident</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>I recently took my cat to a groomer that advertises as being ‘cat only’ and even had a large sign on the front door that said ‘No Dogs’. When my girlfriend dropped my cat off she said there were two medium to large sized dogs that were barking very loudly and freely roaming the small building.</p>
<p>She did not feel very comfortable leaving the cat at the groomer but since we'd paid up front so ultimately decided to follow through. When I arrived to pick him up I had a similar experience, the dogs were running around freely and barking constantly.</p>
<p>The dogs belonged to the owner. They were making so much noise and acting so wild that she decided to let them out. She let them outside with no leash and within a minute they attacked a smaller dog that was being walked on the sidewalk. Her dog picked the smaller dog up, shook it, and threw it.</p>
<p>When she came back in, we confronted her about the situation. We came here so that our cat could be groomed in a less stressful environment and there were two untrained dogs wildly running around and barking. Dogs that clearly demonstrated on another dog what they would do to my cat if they had the chance. When confronted she got a little heated and said next time she would charge us double and that we were lucky she didn’t cut up our cat.</p>
<p>This was not the experience that I paid for, in addition this was not a controlled and safe environment for my pet. Is there a requirement to protect my pet in this situation? Is a cat grooming business that puts animals at risk even allowed to operate?</p>

      <TITLE>Is the statute of limitations fairly irrelevant?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>For example, say someone suffers an injury that produces a neurological condition years later.</p>
<p>Can the statute of limitations be extended basically indefinitely, up to the point the condition occurs?</p>
<p>Say someone breaches a contract and remains in breach of it for years. Does the clock start only at the first breach, or does it continue forever as long as the contract remains in breached state? I.e., can you evade a lawsuit by making a small breach, which is forgiven, then wait 4 years and then you can breach it all you want because the first breach already occured?</p>

      <BODY><p>Is it legal for a private pre-school to ask preschoolers to take-turns to wash everyone's lunch dishes in the kitchen on behalf of all other students? It was a rotational. It was not singling out a specific person. I think two people worked on it cooperatively.</p>
<p>I know a friend in the United States whose pre-school asked them to wash dishes one-day when they were four-years-old. Then the pre-school shutdown some subsequent days later because the nuns ran out of funding.</p>
<p>Is this child-labor/abuse?</p>

      <BODY><p><strong>Can a person be convicted in their home country A for something that is considered a crime in country B (but not a crime in A)?</strong></p>
<p>Take for example something less extreme like, reputational damage of a company, not something like murder, which international police would deal with.  The action itself is not considered a crime in country A (i.e. not enshired by any law), however, in country B it is. The reputational damage is what would derive from it, and that is a crime in both country A and B, however, the company of country B has no presence in country A.</p>

<p>"Republican Texas governor Greg Abbott has signed a law that forbids social media companies from banning people from their platforms based on their location and/or their politics. "</p>
<p>I presume this is intended to prevent things like Twitter banning Trump from posting.</p>
<p>Is this law unconstitutional, on the grounds that it violates freedom of the press?  As I understand it, the First Amendment means the government can't tell any publisher what political opinions they must  publish, or must not publish.  If that is correct, does 'the press' include social media?</p>

      <TITLE>Can quantum mechanics and the fabric of spacetime be a viable defense to battery (or an offense that requires making contact)?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>This might sound off, at first, but bear with me as I explain.</p>

<p>As a thought I have had for sometime, and then later brought to light by other people like in <a href="http://futurism.com/why-you-can-never-actually-touch-anything/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this article</a>, it is not possible to actually touch anything or anyone.</p>

<p>The sensation of touch is fulfilled essentially by electrons repelling where the waves pass through.</p>

<p>Given this is the case, there are many laws which do not have a clear definition of what touch actually consists of, instead focusing more on the action and implied state of matter making contact with matter (which is not possible) and what matter can be (an object, person, etc.).</p>

<p>Given that touch is not possible except under the theory of nuclear fusion where the state of an atom is fused with another atom both requiring an enormous amount of energy of an inconvenienced amount, and releasing under the theory, an unending source of energy, it is safe to say that this doesn't happen in (for example) a fist fight (even though the participants may feel like it had]).</p>

<p>In court, means, motive and opportunity must exist beyond a reasonable doubt. In a case involving a physical contact allegation, wouldn't quantum mechanics and spacetime eliminate the possibility of means?</p>

      <TITLE>Do I have the right to enter into someone house without permission if my child is in there?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>Here's the situation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Main persons:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>my daughter <strong>Maria</strong>, 16 years old</li>
  <li>my daughter's friend <strong>Mario</strong>, over 18 years old</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>My daughter was asked by her friend Mario to hang out at someone's house.</p>
  
  <p>At 1:00 am, while I and her oldest brother (20 years old) were already
  resting, someone knocked on my door and said that Mario (already drunk)
  was getting my daughter to hangout at someone's house. So I woke up her
  oldest brother to go into that house to get his sister.</p>
  
  <p>When we arrived at the house, while we were knocking we heard a noise of
  singing and like partying, but it suddenly stopped when they heard us.</p>
  
  <p>My son looked into the window and saw his sister, he felt angry and 
  without thinking, he jumped through the
  window to get in, he opened the door for me and let me in.
  When we were inside the house, we found people were already gone except 
  for Mario and my daughter.</p>
  
  <p>Mario faked sleeping, while my daughter was sitting next to
  him. So my son woke up Mario and said "If I saw you there, outside,
  I'm gonna punch the hell your face".</p>
  
  <p>By the way, the parents of the child (owner of the house where the
  incident happened) were not at home, and the child of the owner is
  under age of 16.</p>
  
  <p>So, me and my son were trespassing and threatened someone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do we have the right to do that? When my son says "I'm gonna punch your face when I saw you there" is that considered a threat?</p>

<p>PS: This is for educational purpose only, and the situation happened in real life. I'm not in the situation, but due to curiosity I wanted to know what my rights are when this kind of things happen to me, considering I am the father of Maria.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for commenting and those who wrote an answer. After reading those comment and answer I realize that I had a mistake for not clarifying my question.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH COUNTRY</strong></p>

<p>These situation happened in Philippines, but I would like to know if the situation also happen in US and India, so three countries.(US and India is optional, I'm just curious).</p>

<p><strong>THE PARTY</strong></p>

<p>It wasn't a party after all, it's just a hang out leading by MARIO.</p>

<p><strong>THE WINDOW</strong> </p>

<p>The window is not something like a glass, it's an open window, not lock at all.</p>

<p><strong>WHY DO I ASKED THESE QUESTION IF I ALREADY KNOW THAT THE FATHER AND SON IS TRESPASS</strong></p>

<p>I think this is about protecting the child.
Well, I'm currently not in the age of having a son/daughter or family, but you you know, if I we're in the situation maybe because of wanting to protect my daughter/sister, I will do the same(I'm not sure at all). In addition, I would like to know the possible defense that I can make when this kind of situation happen to me. Anyway, sorry for bad English. </p>

<p>So, what I actually want to know is</p>

<p>1: That thing could be consider as a threat?</p>

<p>2: What are the possible defense can I have in these kind of situation?</p>

      <TITLE>What does "Have you been drinking?" really mean?</TITLE>
      <BODY><p>If a police officer asks a driver "Have you been drinking?", then the driver should either plead the fifth (and not answer the question), or answer the question truthfully. Let's assume the driver only answers yes or no for the moment, without divulging further details. Is there a legal definition or understanding which determines whether the driver answered truthfully? Is the question essentially equivalent to "Do you think you currently have any measurable blood alcohol level?"</p>
